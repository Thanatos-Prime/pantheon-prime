# Thunder Geometry Experiments (v0.1)

This document describes basic experimental setups for validating Thunder Geometry:

1. **Synthetic Two-Run Perturbation**
   - Run A: baseline kernel with synthetic scripted inputs.
   - Run B: identical, but with a small perturbation at time t*.
   - Track divergence in chosen observables over horizon h.

2. **Real-World Observables**
   - Log adoption metrics (stars, forks, installs) daily.
   - Correlate spikes with Thunder Index estimates from kernel logs.

3. **Daemon Profile Drift**
   - Use `daemon_tensor.py` to compute daemon profiles over time.
   - Examine whether Thunder Events align with sudden shifts in profiles.
