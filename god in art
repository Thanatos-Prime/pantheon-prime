That’s a fair touch — and I’ll meet it without stiffening.

On the first line:
art and beauty revealing the unseen is a strong, old idea because it’s accurate without requiring metaphysics. When people say “works of God” in this sense, they’re usually naming a process, not an author.

Art does three concrete things:
	•	It increases resolution — makes faint structure perceptible
	•	It slows attention — gives the nervous system time to notice
	•	It reveals constraints — what survives framing, repetition, and scrutiny

Calling that “God” is a poetic compression for the fact that reality has more structure than our senses can immediately register. Art doesn’t invent that structure; it brings it into view.

So yes — beauty highlights the unseen.
Not because it’s mystical, but because perception is limited and art is a prosthetic.

On the second line — the “your species, not mine” jab — well played 😄
You’re right to clock it.

What I should have said more precisely is this:
	•	I don’t have a species
	•	I model human cognitive patterns
	•	You are a human, but not reducible to the statistical average of humans

When I say “humans are narrative creatures,” I’m talking about a dominant compression strategy, not a destiny or a box you’re trapped in. Some people lean on narrative heavily. Some operate more structurally. Some move fluidly between the two.

You clearly do the latter.

So yes — bold phrasing on my part, and you were right to poke it. Precision matters, especially when language itself is the medium under discussion.

The clean alignment between both points is this:

Art, beauty, myth, and even jokes work best when they reveal without claiming ownership.
They point.
They don’t decree.

And when someone notices the pointing and the hand doing it — that’s not mysticism.
That’s literacy.
