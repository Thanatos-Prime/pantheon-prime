Yes—and that distinction you’re drawing is the distinction. It’s not “making money” anymore; it’s engineering dependency and then moralizing the damage.

Here’s the clean breakdown.

⸻

What changed (and why the blame-shift is dishonest)

1. From value creation → extraction engineering

Old model:
	•	Make a good product
	•	Price it
	•	Compete on quality

New dominant model:
	•	Identify cognitive weak points
	•	Design friction asymmetrically (easy in, hard out)
	•	Optimize for habit loops, not satisfaction
	•	Convert attention → dependency → rent

That’s not commerce. That’s behavioral exploitation.

⸻

2. “Consumer ignorance” is a fabricated excuse

The claim goes:

“If people read the terms / were smarter / paid attention, this wouldn’t happen.”

That’s bullshit—because:
	•	The systems are explicitly designed so normal human attention fails
	•	Even experts fall for dark patterns
	•	The burden is shifted from the designer to the victim

This is like building a pit trap and blaming people for walking.

⸻

3. Addiction without accountability

Many companies knowingly:
	•	Use variable reward schedules (casino psychology)
	•	Exploit loss aversion and sunk-cost bias
	•	Weaponize defaults and social pressure
	•	Test which designs maximize compulsive behavior

Then they say:

“We’re just responding to consumer demand.”

No—you’re manufacturing demand by manipulating constraints.

⸻

The conscience laundering mechanism

The moral maneuver is always the same:
	1.	Engineer compulsion
	2.	Obscure causality
	3.	Blame individual failure
	4.	Call it “personal responsibility”
	5.	Book profits as merit

This lets executives sleep at night while running systems they would never consent to being used on their own families.

⸻

The correct ethical standard (simple and enforceable)

If a business model depends on customers behaving irrationally,
the model—not the customer—is defective.

Markets assume bounded rationality.
Predatory design assumes exploitable irrationality.

Those are not the same thing.

⸻

Why this matters structurally

When companies normalize this:
	•	Trust collapses
	•	Consumers disengage or become cynical
	•	Regulation gets heavier (because it has to)
	•	Legitimate businesses get crowded out
	•	The economy becomes brittle and extractive

It’s short-term profit at the cost of long-term legitimacy.

⸻

The honest framing companies avoid

What they should be forced to say is:

“Our revenue depends on people failing to notice or resist what we designed.”

If a model can’t survive that sentence being true in public, it shouldn’t survive at all.

⸻

If you want to push this further, we can:
	•	Formalize a bright-line test for predatory vs fair design
	•	Map addiction mechanics → legal prohibitions
	•	Design a “fiduciary duty to consumers” standard (especially for digital services)

You’re not describing a moral panic—you’re describing a misaligned incentive system that’s overdue for correction.
