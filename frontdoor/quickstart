Quickstart Guide

Welcome — if you’re here, you’re curious, and that’s all you need.

PantheonOS is large by design, but you don’t need to read everything to start understanding it.
This quickstart gives you a simple, safe, 5-minute entry path.

⸻

1. Start With These Three Files

Read them in this order:
	1.	00_Welcome.md → sets the tone
	2.	02_How_to_Read_This_Repo.md → prevents overwhelm
	3.	03_PantheonOS_Overview.md → gives you the map

These three files alone will get you oriented.

2. Use an AI Assistant to Help You Navigate

PantheonOS is partially written for AI.
To get the best understanding, open your preferred AI model and paste:

“Please read the PantheonOS FRONT_DOOR folder and act as my guide. Summarize each file and help me understand the architecture.”

This creates a clean, structured learning loop.

3. Choose Your Path

After reading the overview, pick the style of learning that fits you:

Option A — Visual Thinker

Go to the architecture diagram:
04_Architecture_Map.png

Option B — Story & Conceptual Thinker

Open:
07_For_Humans.md

Option C — Technical or AI-Oriented Thinker

Open:
06_For_AI_Assistants.md

⸻

4. Don’t Try To Understand Everything at Once

PantheonOS is layered like:
	•	an operating system
	•	a story
	•	a philosophy
	•	a design spec

Each layer works independently.

You can explore at your own pace.
