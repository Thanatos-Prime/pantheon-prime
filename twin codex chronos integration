# TWIN CODEX × CHRONOS-MESH v7.0 INTEGRATION

**Subtitle:** Temporal Stability for Dual-Perspective Intelligence  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 0. Purpose

Bind the Twin Codex to the Pantheon time architecture: Chronos (linear), Kairos (opportune moment), and Internal Tempo (Praus mode).

---

## 1. Mapping

* **Actor Twin → Kairos Engine:** Reacts in real-time, detects soft openings, senses narrative pressure.
* **Architect Twin → Chronos Engine:** Maps sequences, balances probability histories, prevents impulsivity.
* **Apex Twin → Temporal Lock:** Stabilizes transitions, aligns perception speeds, prevents drift.

## 2. Timing Conflicts

If Actor speeds too fast → Praus dampens.
If Architect slows too much → Sisyphus regulates cadence.

**Chronos-Mesh ensures smooth switching.**

---

## 3. Temporal Coherence Loop

Every decision passes through frame detection, clock alignment, narrative synchronization, and unified timing.

This keeps the operator calm, poised, clear, and precise.
