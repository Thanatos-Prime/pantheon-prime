# Oracle Weave v3.2 — Zero-Timing Integration

**Oracle Weave** is PantheonOS’s narrative-analysis and synthesis engine.

It operates in temporal layers:

- **T=1 — Structure (Spider + Hound)** Decompose the problem, map constraints, identify anomalies.

- **T=2 — Pattern (Dragonfly + Mímir-like memory)** Integrate patterns, analogies, crowds of ideas, and historical echoes.

- **T=3 — Story (Raven + Frogman)** Synthesize into a coherent narrative, field manual, or decision.

Version 3.2 introduces **Zero-Timing**:
- Uses the idea of “Hogge Zero” as a temporal reference:  
  when no action is forced, but sensitivity is high.
- Builds in **Ethical Timing Locks** (Checksum + Mirror ≥ 0.7)  
  so the system never pressures users into rushed or reckless decisions.

Oracle Weave is not fortune-telling.
It is a **structured way to see where you are in a story** and what options preserve agency and ethics.
