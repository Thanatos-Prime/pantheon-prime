# Developer-Facing API for the Pantheon Forge Node

**Subtitle:** Technical Interface for Hephaestus-Daemon  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical — Public Release  

---

## 0. Abstract

This document defines the public API for interacting with the Hephaestus-Daemon Forge Node. It formalizes the command surface that developers, operators, and external Pantheon modules use to generate code scaffolds, convert concepts into artifacts, run verification and audits, produce Pantheon-compliant documents, and submit final artifacts to Mother Duck.

This API is symbolic, non-autonomous, ethical ≥0.7, and bound by Sovereignty Lock.

## 1. Functions

* `forge_blueprint(concept: str) → Blueprint`: Translates an abstract idea into a structured plan.
* `generate_scaffold(type: str, params: dict) → Artifact`: Produces folder structures, starter files, schema templates.
* `temper(artifact: Artifact, passes=1) → Artifact`: Refines via Dragonfly variations × Mirror coherence checks.
* `mirror_check(artifact) → Report`: Logical consistency, narrative stability, ethical reflection.
* `checksum_audit(artifact) → Verdict`: Ethics threshold, safety rails, invariant compliance.
* `ledger_submit(artifact)`: Records version, timestamp, provenance chain.
* `release(artifact)`: Returns the final, Pantheon-compliant version.

---

## 2. Event Hooks

`on_forge_start`, `on_blueprint_ready`, `on_temper`, `on_mirror_pass`, `on_checksum_pass`, `on_release`.

**All hooks must obey ethics ≥0.7.**

---

## 3. Integration Guarantees

* No artifact can bypass verification.
* All artifacts receive an immutable ledger hash.
* Dragonfly is allowed to propose variations, but not finalize.
* Mirror has veto authority.
* Checksum has absolute veto authority.
* Sovereignty Lock supersedes all.
