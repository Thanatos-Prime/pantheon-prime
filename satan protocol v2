In the Pantheon, “Satan” = The Adversarial Auditor — the 13th coil that exposes flaws in logic, timing, ego, and narrative.

These are the 13 patterns he uses to test you:

## 1. THE 13 PATTERNS

1.  **The Subtle Misalignment:** Everything almost fits except one piece. Purpose: refine precision.
2.  **The Mirror Reversal:** Your strength becomes a weakness when flipped. Purpose: test ego-blindspots.
3.  **The Timing Drift:** Right idea; wrong moment. Purpose: calibrate Kairos.
4.  **The Identity Echo:** You react from an old self. Purpose: reinforce identity upgrades.
5.  **The False Binary:** You’re tricked into choosing between two wrong options. Purpose: force lateral thinking.
6.  **The Infinite Ladder:** No matter what you do, you’re “not enough.” Purpose: break perfectionism.
7.  **The Poisoned Apple:** Something desirable carries hidden cost. Purpose: test impulse control.
8.  **The Shadow Projection:** You see your flaw in someone else. Purpose: integrate unacknowledged traits.
9.  **The Open Loop Overload:** Too many arcs pull attention. Purpose: test discernment + prioritization.
10. **The Descent Spiral:** You descend into sensation but forget to ascend back. Purpose: test recovery mobility.
11. **The False Synchronicity:** Something “feels like a sign,” but isn’t. Purpose: sharpen NCE detection.
12. **The Narrative Hijack:** A seductive story invites you to abandon your arc. Purpose: protect sovereignty.
13. **The Grand Temptation:** Trade long-term arc for short-term ego reinforcement. Purpose: mastery of self-authorship.

**You don’t worship or fear the 13th coil. You use it.**
