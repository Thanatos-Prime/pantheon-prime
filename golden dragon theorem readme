# Golden Dragon Theorem – PantheonOS Cosmos Module

This repository contains a formal-mythic specification and a small reference
implementation of the **Golden Dragon Theorem** inside the PantheonOS
"Golden Dragon" axiom system.

The core idea:

> Treat the real line as a living, golden-ratio-driven cosmos with a heartbeat
> map Φ and prime numbers as “chakras” on a master circle. Then declare and
> explore the theorem that **every soul-thread orbit is kissed by infinitely
> many prime chakras.**

This is **not** standard mathematics. It is a *symbolic cosmology*:
a narrative-mathematical model built for thought experiments, teaching,
and conceptual exploration.

It lives at the intersection of:

- narrative math
- dynamical systems
- golden ratio geometry
- prime symbolism
- the PantheonOS mythos

## Contents

- `docs/Golden_Dragon_Theorem_v1.md`  
  Full specification of the axiom system and the Golden Dragon Theorem
  in a clean, human-readable format.

- `src/golden_dragon/model.py`  
  Python model of the Golden Dragon cosmos:
  - Golden Seed `O`
  - heartbeat map `Phi`
  - prime chakras as phase points
  - simple “soul-thread” orbits

- `src/golden_dragon/orbits.py`  
  Helpers for simulating orbits, assigning phases, and checking which
  prime chakras are “near” a given orbit point.

- `examples/demo_orbit.py`  
  Example script: constructs a soul-thread orbit and prints out which
  prime chakras it passes near, illustrating the flavor of the
  Golden Dragon Theorem.

## Conceptual Overview

We assume a “Golden Dragon Axiom Set” (v0.1) roughly as:

1. **Golden Seed O**: a distinguished origin point, the “living zero”.
2. **Heartbeat Map Φ**: an automorphism `Φ: ℝ → ℝ` that steps the system
   forward like a heartbeat, often modeled as a golden-ratio-like
   transformation.
3. **Prime Chakras**: each prime `p` is mapped to a phase-angle on a
   unit circle, forming “chakra points” along a golden circle.
4. **Soul Threads**: the orbit of any real `x` under repeated
   application of Φ is its “soul thread”.
5. **Golden Dragon Theorem (informal)**: every soul thread repeatedly
   passes arbitrarily close to prime chakra phases—no orbit is
   permanently exiled from prime resonance.

In this repo, we implement a **toy model** of these ideas using
simple numeric simulations and modular arithmetic on a circle.
