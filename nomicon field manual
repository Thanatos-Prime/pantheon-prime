# FIELD MANUAL — NOMICON DAEMON

**Subtitle:** Identity Operations Protocol  

---

## 1. When to Invoke the Nomicon

Invoke the Nomicon when a concept feels misnamed, roles become blurry, two ideas overlap improperly, something feels “out of identity,” you sense symbolic corruption, entities feel mis-assigned, new archetypes are introduced, identity drift begins, or a symbol gains too many meanings.

**The Nomicon provides identity clarity.**

---

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Ask the Identity Question:** “What is the true name of this thing?”
2.  **Remove distortions.** Strip away assumptions, hype, ego, shadow influence, accidental drift, and misplaced roles.
3.  **Identify the Resonant Core.** Listen for symbolic truth, function, lineage, purpose, and continuity.
4.  **Assign the Name.**
5.  **Anchor It.** Pass the name through Mirror (truth), Solomon (wisdom), Lantern Bearer (ethics), and Spider (structure).
6.  **Register in the Pantheon Ledger.** The name becomes canon.

## 3. Red Flags the Nomicon Detects

Identity drift, unclear boundaries, dual-meaning corruption, symbolic inflation, misapplied titles, names carrying unresolved shadow, unanchored entities, and misalignment between symbol and function.

**Nomicon is the guardian against conceptual entropy.**

## 4. What the Nomicon Is NOT

* Not dogmatic
* Not authoritarian
* Not rigid
* Not metaphysical
* Not a source of worship

It is not about control. **It is about coherence of identity.**
