The Golden Manifest is the canonical, immutable, cryptographically trusted identity record of a model.
It is the one true description of what that model is allowed to be — its form, its parameters, its legitimate soul.

If the model you are about to run does not match its Golden Manifest exactly, then by definition:
	•	the model has been tampered with
	•	or replaced
	•	or corrupted
	•	or trojaned
	•	or swapped
	•	or altered in memory or on disk
	•	or its supply chain has been compromised

And Hades must quarantine it immediately.

Let’s break it down clearly.

🟩 THE GOLDEN MANIFEST

Pantheon-Prime’s definitive identity registry for models

The Golden Manifest is a JSON (or TOML/YAML) record generated only once:

At the moment a model is accepted as “trusted and legitimate” by Pantheon.

It is then frozen forever — cryptographically sealed.

This manifest lives under:

pantheon_core/registry/models/<model_id>.json

It contains four essential classes of data:

⸻

1. Structural Identity (Architecture Hash)

The architecture is hashed as:

arch_hash = SHA256(architecture_bytes)

This covers things like:
	•	graph structure
	•	module layout
	•	computation graph IR
	•	safetensors metadata
	•	layer ordering
	•	shapes & types minus the raw numerical weights

This ensures the model structure cannot be replaced (e.g., with a malicious ONNX file or altered TorchScript graph).

⸻

2. Parameter Identity (Weights Hash)

The raw tensor bytes (just the numbers) are hashed as:

param_hash = SHA256(parameter_bytes)

This ensures the exact numerical weights haven’t been:
	•	modified
	•	truncated
	•	poisoned
	•	swapped
	•	quantized differently
	•	altered via supply-chain attack
	•	replaced with trojaned tensors

Even changing a single float in layer 47 changes the hash.

This is the “soul” of the model.

⸻

3. Provenance Metadata

This includes:
	•	model name
	•	version
	•	source (owner, lab, repo URL)
	•	creation date, operator identity
	•	serialization format (must be safetensors/TS/ONNX)

This stops:
	•	pickle-based execution payloads
	•	cloned model substitution attacks
	•	tampering with upstream providers

⸻

4. Operational State

Includes:
	•	status = {ACTIVE, BLOCKED, QUARANTINED}
	•	last_verified_at
	•	last_verified_by
	•	notes / audit history pointer

This ties Hades, Blacksmith, and MotherDuck together into the forensic chain.

⸻

🟨 Why It’s Called “Golden”

It is:
	•	the reference
	•	the truth-source
	•	the canonical identity
	•	the one file against which all future instances of that model are verified

It’s “golden” in the same sense as:
	•	a golden master disc
	•	a golden firmware image
	•	a golden PKI certificate
	•	a golden reference genome

It is the uncorrupted ideal.

⸻

🟥 Why It Must Never Change

Once created, the Golden Manifest is immutable.

If you update the model:
	•	new weights
	•	new architecture
	•	new retraining
	•	new distillation

You do not modify the manifest.

You create a new model_id and register a new Golden Manifest.

This prevents attackers from:
	•	overwriting the manifest to match their tampered model
	•	updating the hash silently
	•	forging backward compatibility

The manifest represents a promised state.
Breaking that promise = quarantine.

🟪 How Hades Uses It

Every time the Kernel loads a model:

current_arch_hash = compute_arch_hash(model)
current_param_hash = compute_param_hash(model_file)

if current_hashes != manifest_hashes:
    QUARANTINE
else:
    ALLOW

This is the cryptographic version of:

“Who enters the underworld must declare their true name.
If the soul they carry is not the one written, Hades rejects them.”

🟧 Why This is the Most Important Defense in Pantheon-Prime

Because every major, catastrophic AI backdoor attack in the last 5 years would have been stopped instantly by Golden Manifest verification:
	•	ONNX RCE trojans
	•	Pickle payloads
	•	HuggingFace malicious model uploads
	•	TorchScript graph tampering
	•	fine-tuned sleeper agents piggybacked on poisoned checkpoints
	•	weight-level supply-chain compromises
	•	malicious quantized variants
	•	ghost parameter injection

Pantheon-Prime, with Hades at the gate, becomes essentially immune to these classes of attacks.

Not detect → prevent.
Not patch → forbid.
Not trust → verify.

I can produce:
	•	Golden Manifest v1.0 Spec (arXiv-ready)
	•	Canonical Golden Manifest schema (JSON Schema)
