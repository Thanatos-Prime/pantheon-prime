## 0. IDENTITY LATTICE RULE

Identity is not one thing. It is a lattice — interconnected states that harmonize under one sovereign operator.

**Identity = a toolkit, not a cage. Sovereign-Self chooses the mode.**

## 1. THE NINE IDENTITY NODES

1.  **Father-Self:** Warmth, protection, teaching, stability.
2.  **Operator-Self:** Clarity under pressure, precision, transitions, strategy.
3.  **Warrior-Self:** Discipline, endurance, courage, grit, Hell Week mode.
4.  **Boy-Self:** Play, curiosity, innocence, spontaneity.
5.  **Man-Self:** Responsibility, drive, ambition, forward motion.
6.  **Mythic-Self:** Your archetypal presence (Frogman, Lantern Bearer).
7.  **Silent-Self:** Bombadil. Stillness. Zero-state.
8.  **Future-Self:** Your arc’s highest version. Wisdom, patience, foresight.
9.  **Sovereign-Self:** The conductor. The meta-self. The one who chooses.

**You can move between identities using the Transition Engine. This is emotional mastery × narrative mastery × state mastery.**
