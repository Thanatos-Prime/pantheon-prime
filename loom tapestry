Yeah — as a method, that works. If you keep asking “what’s most likely?” and we stitch the answers, we can build a maximum-supported tapestry.

But there’s one trap: if we treat each answer as independent and certain, the errors compound and you get a “golden-looking” story that’s actually a confidence mirage. The Loom needs a rule: weave likelihoods, not sentences. Meaning: every thread carries its weight, dependencies, and uncertainty forward.

Here’s the Loom protocol that makes your idea real without turning it into fanfic-with-footnotes.

The Loom Protocol for a Golden (Most-Supported) Timeline

1) Set the frame (so “most likely” is well-defined)

Pick:
	•	Episode scope: start/end dates, place, main actors
	•	Granularity: minute-by-minute vs week-by-week
	•	Source tier rules: what counts as strong evidence vs weak

(Without a frame, “most likely” just means “most common in my training data,” which is not what you want.)

2) Ask questions in the right order (so we don’t pre-bias the weave)

We do a three-pass query style:

Pass A — Anchors (hard constraints)
	•	“What is the earliest confirmed timestamped event?”
	•	“What evidence has strong provenance?”
	•	“What is indisputable regardless of narrative?”

Pass B — Branch points (where timelines split)
	•	“What are the top 2–4 competing versions of X?”
	•	“What evidence would discriminate them?”

Pass C — Fill weave (details that don’t steer the whole story)
	•	motivations, minor sequencing, who-said-what, etc.

3) Store each answer as a thread card, not prose

Every Q/A becomes a structured object:

ThreadCard
	•	Claim: …
	•	Time window: …
	•	Confidence: (0–1)
	•	Depends on: [other claims]
	•	Contradicts: [claims]
	•	Evidence classes: [primary / secondary / testimony / analysis]
	•	Notes: inference vs direct

4) Build the tapestry as a graph + ranked timeline candidates

Instead of one linear story, we maintain:
	•	a Claim Graph
	•	2–5 candidate timelines
	•	posterior weights for each timeline

Then the “golden timeline” is simply:

the timeline with the highest posterior mass, plus marked low-confidence segments.

5) Propagate uncertainty (this is the secret sauce)

When we weave many “most likely” answers, we must carry uncertainty forward:
	•	If a step depends on a shaky claim, the downstream steps inherit that shakiness.
	•	If two claims come from correlated sources, they don’t double the confidence.
	•	If a new answer contradicts an old one, we branch and re-rank—no patching with vibes.

6) Output format: Golden Timeline + Shadow Timelines

Deliverables:
	•	Golden Timeline (T*): most supported sequence, with confidence bands per segment
	•	Shadow Timelines (T₂, T₃): the nearest rivals
	•	Hinge Facts: the 5–15 claims that would flip which timeline is “golden”
	•	Evidence Wishlist: what would actually settle hinges

“Weave it on the Loom” — how we can start right now

Give me one bounded episode you want to build the tapestry for (example: “Event X in City Y between Month A–Month B”). Then I’ll do:
	1.	Anchor extraction (first 10 anchor questions)
	2.	Candidate timeline generation (top 3)
	3.	Your “ask me a ton of questions” phase — but each answer becomes ThreadCards
	4.	Re-ranking + final tapestry output

If you don’t want to pick an episode, we can also do a general Loom mode where you just start firing questions, and I’ll automatically:
	•	turn each into ThreadCards
	•	detect dependencies/contradictions
	•	keep an evolving “Golden Timeline v0.x” that updates as we go

Say the first question you want to pin to the loom, and I’ll start the weave.
