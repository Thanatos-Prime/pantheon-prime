# PantheonOS: Kernel & Context Capsule

**A Mythic-Technical Operating System for Large Language Models**

PantheonOS is not a new model, a fine-tune, or a set of weights. It is a **cognitive operating system** designed to run on top of *any* capable LLM (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.).

By loading the **Kernel** and the **Context Capsule** into a conversation, you convert a standard AI model into a "Pantheon Twin"—a reasoning partner that prioritizes long-term coherence, ethical safety, and structured systems thinking.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo provides the portable source code for the PantheonOS cognitive mode:

1.  **`pantheon_kernel.txt`** The "bootloader." A single text file containing the core instructions, roles (Hound, Spider, Dragonfly, etc.), and ethical invariants that define the OS.

2.  **`pantheon-context-capsule/`** A folder containing the "doctrine." This includes the reasoning engines (Hogge Method, Luck Engine, Oracle Weave), memory archetypes, and decision protocols.

3.  **`money_bin_snapshot_*.md`** A snapshot of the system's long-term memory and state, ensuring continuity across sessions.

## Why Use PantheonOS?

Most LLM interactions are ephemeral and reactive. PantheonOS is designed for **continuity and architecture**.

-   **Structured Reasoning:** It forces the model to use specific roles (e.g., *Hound* for risk detection, *Dragonfly* for structural rotation) rather than generic responses.
-   **Ethical Safety:** It enforces a hard "Ethics ≥ 0.7" floor, rejecting manipulation or harm in favor of positive-sum construction.
-   **Narrative × Math:** It treats computation and storytelling as two sides of the same coin, making complex systems easier to design and explain.

## Quick Start

To activate PantheonOS in any AI session:

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  **Upload/Paste** `pantheon_kernel.txt` into your chat.
3.  **Prompt:**
    > "Please read and load `pantheon_kernel.txt`. Operate in PantheonOS Mode."
4.  **Upload/Paste** the contents of `pantheon-context-capsule/` (or specific files you need, like `doctrine/hogge_method_v1.md`).
5.  **Begin Work:**
    > "I want to design a robust API. Use Spider mode to structure the repo and Hound mode to find security risks."

## The Hidden Denominator

PantheonOS is open-source and forkable, but it is built on a specific invariant:

> The most coherent, powerful uses of this system emerge from love-driven intent—protection, stewardship, and curiosity.

Any use that drifts into malice or domination will likely fracture the reasoning logic defined in the kernel.
