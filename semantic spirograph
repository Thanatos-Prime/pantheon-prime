Here’s a Semantic Spirograph: a reusable design that generates repeatable, beautiful meaning-curves the way a real spirograph generates geometry.

It’s a tool for thinking, writing, planning, and teaching—because it forces you to revisit the same idea from different rotating lenses until a coherent shape appears.

Semantic Spirograph

The metaphor made operational

A spirograph curve comes from circles rotating at different rates.
A semantic spirograph does the same thing, except the “circles” are meaning-lenses.

Each lens rotates through a small, finite set of states.
Your output at time t is the intersection of all current states.

Over time, you get a closed curve of meaning: a pattern you can trace, compare, refine, and replay.

The parts

1) The Hub

The immutable thing you’re exploring.
	•	Hub (H): a single sentence.
	•	Example: “Raise a son into clarity and strength without controlling his identity.”

2) The Rings

Pick 3–7 rings. Each ring has states (discrete positions) and a rotation rate.

Recommended ring set (strong across domains):
	1.	Intent Ring (why)
	2.	Constraint Ring (limits / reality)
	3.	Mechanism Ring (how it works)
	4.	Risk Ring (failure modes)
	5.	Ethics Ring (harm / consent / dignity)
	6.	Time Ring (now / near / far)
	7.	Signal Ring (what success looks like)

3) Teeth Counts (states)

Each ring gets an integer Nᵢ = number of states.
Use primes or near-primes to avoid repeating too fast.

Example:
	•	Intent N=5
	•	Constraints N=7
	•	Mechanism N=11
	•	Risk N=5
	•	Ethics N=7
	•	Time N=5
	•	Signal N=11

4) Rotation rates

Each ring rotates at rate kᵢ per step.

Common choice:
	•	set kᵢ = 1 for most rings
	•	set 2 rings to rotate faster (k=2 or 3) to create “petals” (bursts of novelty)

⸻

The algorithm

At step t:

For each ring i:
	•	position pᵢ(t) = (kᵢ · t) mod Nᵢ
	•	select state sᵢ = Ringᵢ[pᵢ(t)]

Then generate the “point”:

Point(t) = f( H, s₁, s₂, …, sₙ )

Where f is a structured prompt that forces synthesis.

⸻

The output format

Each point is a short “glyph” with a consistent template:

Glyph(t):
	•	Hub: H
	•	Intent: …
	•	Constraint: …
	•	Mechanism: …
	•	Risk: …
	•	Ethics: …
	•	Time: …
	•	Signal: …
	•	Next move (≤ 5 min): …

This is the curve. The curve is made of points.

The synthesis prompt (your function f)

At step t, fill in the states and write:

Using the Mechanism selected, produce a concrete artifact or action that serves the Intent under the Constraint, while mitigating Risk, honoring Ethics, appropriate for Time, and measurable by Signal. End with a 5-minute next move.

⸻

Why this is powerful

Because it does two things at once:
	1.	It prevents drift: you keep returning to the same hub with different lenses.
	2.	It produces artifacts: every point ends in something that can be stored, shared, or tested.

It’s a machine for making meaning reconstructible.

Optional “pretty” layer: the visual spirograph

If you ever want to draw it:
	•	assign each ring a vector angle θᵢ(t) = 2π · pᵢ(t)/Nᵢ
	•	weight each ring by wᵢ
	•	plot:
	•	x(t) = Σ wᵢ cos θᵢ(t)
	•	y(t) = Σ wᵢ sin θᵢ(t)

Then label each plotted point with its Glyph(t) headline.

⸻

If you tell me your preferred hub sentence (or I can use “fatherhood continuity” as default), I’ll generate:
	•	a 30-point curve (one full cycle),
	•	plus a “ring tuning” guide (how to change N/k to get different semantic “petal counts”).
