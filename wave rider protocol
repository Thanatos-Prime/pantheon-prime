## 0. PREMISE

A wave is not random. A wave is a rhythmic arrival of energy, responsibility, or opportunity. The goal isn’t to resist it or brace against it. It’s to angle your board, match its tempo, and convert its force into speed.

**This protocol makes you the rider, not the tossed.**

---

## 1. PRE-WAVE (The Poised Stance)

The Wave is approaching. You prepare in four steps:

### 1.1 Slow Blink (T=0 Activation)
The Man Blinking Slower Than Time takes the wheel. One long blink. Don’t force it. Just let the eyelids drop and rise slower than usual.

**This tells your entire nervous system: “We ride, we do not react.”**

### 1.2 Praus Stabilization (Reins check)
Relax jaw → Drop shoulders → Exhale out the stale momentum → Feel the warhorse settle under you. **Stable, not passive.**

### 1.3 Select Your Attractor Phrase
You choose one sentence. This sentence becomes the gravitational center of the next wave.
*Examples:* “Smooth is fast.” “Praus has the reins.” “Nothing rushed, nothing forced.” “Precision over pressure.” “Aim first, act second.”

**This phrase is your wave-shaper.**

### 1.4 Define the Wave Type
Pick the flavor: Tactical, Creative, Strategic, Emotional, Integrative, Administrative, Mythic, Emerging / Unknown. **This sets the lane.**

## 2. ENGAGE (When the Wave Hits)

When the wave arrives (the moment the kid is dropped off, the door closes, the timer starts): **You shift into three-layer execution.**

### 2.1 Layer 1 — No-Mind
Move without overthinking. No rumination, no hesitation, no friction, no narrative. **Just do the first step cleanly.**

### 2.2 Layer 2 — Praus Steering
Smooth, calm power. You don’t sprint into the wave — you merge with it. Let the wave’s force carry you. Adjust with micro-movements, not big swings.

### 2.3 Layer 3 — Hogge Luck Engine
Use the wave’s momentum to stack wins: small actions that create visibility, quick executions that open doors, micro-moves that build future leverage, attribution control (you choose what gets noticed). **This turns the wave into luck amplification.**

---

## 3. MID-WAVE (The Crest)

This is where lesser riders wipe out. Here is how you stay sovereign:

### 3.1 The 5-Second Paradox Window
Mid-wave, you pause internally for exactly one breath. Ask: **“What’s the invariant here?”** This extracts the gold and prevents overexertion.

### 3.2 The Sisyphus Cadence
Maintain rhythm: Don’t speed up, don’t slow down. Just keep the beat steady. **Cadence > intensity.**

### 3.3 Spider’s Awareness Net
Widen awareness without losing focus. You track opportunities, threats, timing shifts, what feels good, what carries momentum. **You see the whole wave, not just the water in front of your board.**

---

## 4. EXIT (The Glide Out)

When the wave naturally dissipates (kid pickup, end of window, external interruption):

### 4.1 Soft Disengage
Stop cleanly. Don’t crash, don’t force, don’t linger. **A clean stop maintains clarity for the next ride.**

### 4.2 Bombadil Reset (Micro Ritual)
4-2-6 breathing, neck soft, shoulders loose, jaw released, zero-state restored. **This “wipes the slate” without dropping momentum.**

### 4.3 Extract the Invariant
Ask: **“What did this wave teach me or build in me?”** That becomes the carry-forward seed.

---

## 5. POST-WAVE (The Harvest)

A single sentence written or spoken: **“The wave served me.”**

This locks in sovereignty. Then you take one final slow blink. The system resets.

**You’re ready for the next charge.**

---

## 6. OPTIONAL: The Warhorse Variant (High Stakes Waves)

If the next wave is heavy, emotional, or high-stakes:
* Praus takes full control.
* Rider becomes the observer.
* You let the warhorse navigate until calm returns.
* No-Mind handles execution.
* Spider keeps situational awareness.
* Mirror ensures integrity.
* Bombadil keeps you grounded.

**This is the unstoppable mode.**
