# PANTHEONOS MODULE: CONTINUITY CORE v1.0

**File:** `/pantheon/continuity/core.md`  
**Status:** Canonical Module  

## Purpose
Provides a unifying substrate for memory, narrative, identity, and long-term process flow across the PantheonOS ecosystem.

## Conceptual Responsibilities
* Manage cross-session conceptual invariants
* Link primitives into persistent structures
* Maintain “semantic gravity” so ideas return naturally
* Prevent fragmentation of meaning
* Provide anchor points for narrative coherence
* Enable multi-module evolution

## Key Components

### 1. Continuity Kernel
The minimal set of stable references: Core primitives, Key doctrines, User-identity anchors, Ethical guardrails (Sieve of Hogge), Time constructs (Trident of Time).

### 2. Continuity Ledger (Mother Duck Layer)
Append-only record of concept evolution, module updates, timestamped changes, narrative compression, and integrity proofs.

### 3. Continuity Mesh
Network of recurring patterns: motifs, invariants, primitives, themes, operators, architecture rules.

### 4. Continuity Interface
APIs allowing modules to request context, bind new ideas to older ones, inherit structure, stabilize new concepts, and merge with prior states.

## Continuity Rules
1.  No recursion without an anchor
2.  No evolution without a reference
3.  No cross-module link without coherence
4.  No state update without ethics check
5.  No meaning without context
