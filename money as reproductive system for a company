Exactly — and that’s the clean, non-moral way to see it.

What changed is not the signal.
What changed is the reproductive substrate.

From bush → brand (same logic, new medium)

A berry bush “wants” (mechanically, not consciously) to:
	•	Attract attention
	•	Be consumed
	•	Have its seeds spread
	•	Occupy more territory next season

A company “wants” (again, mechanically):
	•	Capture attention
	•	Trigger consumption
	•	Reinvest profit
	•	Expand market share

So the mapping is tight:

Nature	Corporation
Berry	Candy
Color & sweetness	Packaging & flavor engineering
Seeds	Brand memory + habit
Dispersal via animals	Distribution + advertising
Ecological niche	Market niche

No intention required.
Just selection pressure.

⸻

Money = the new reproductive medium

In biology:
	•	Energy → reproduction

In capitalism:
	•	Money → reproduction

Profit is not “evil” or “greedy” — it’s just the energy unit of the system.

A company that doesn’t convert:
	•	attention → revenue → reinvestment

…dies, the same way a plant that fails to reproduce disappears from the gene pool.

So candy companies aren’t villains.
They’re hyper-fit organisms in an artificial ecology.

⸻

The critical difference (this is where imbalance comes from)

Natural systems have:
	•	Seasonal scarcity
	•	Physical effort
	•	Built-in brakes
	•	Predator/prey balance
	•	Ecological ceilings

Corporate systems often remove:
	•	Seasonality
	•	Effort
	•	Saturation signals
	•	Long-term feedback

So you get runaway fitness.

It’s not that the company is “too smart” —
it’s that the environment stopped constraining it.

Same reason invasive species dominate:
	•	Not malicious
	•	Just unconstrained

⸻

Tie-back to the sand timer model

Candy-as-company works because:
	•	The sand (attention, craving) flows fast
	•	The neck (constraints) is widened
	•	Settling never happens
	•	The system oscillates instead (cravings, overconsumption)

This is exactly what happens when you:
	•	Flip the hourglass
	•	Remove the sieve
	•	Optimize only for throughput

Short-term gain, long-term instability.

⸻

One precise invariant (Pantheon-worthy)

Here’s the sentence that nails it:

Corporations are evolutionary agents whose genes are incentives and whose reproduction occurs through attention and money.

And the corollary:

When selection pressure is misaligned with human well-being, fitness increases while health declines.

No conspiracy.
No villain.
Just systems doing what systems do.

⸻

Why this matters for agency (not blame)

Once you see this:
	•	You stop moralizing consumption
	•	You stop shaming people
	•	You stop anthropomorphizing companies

And you start asking the only useful question:

Where should friction be reintroduced so the system can settle again?

That’s:
	•	regulation
	•	norms
	•	personal boundaries
	•	redesigning incentives
	•	restoring seasonality and limits

That’s engineering, not outrage.

⸻

Final grounding

You’re not saying “companies are bad.”
You’re saying:

“We transplanted biological strategies into a new ecology and removed the constraints that made them safe.”

That’s a systems diagnosis, not a rant.

And it fits perfectly with everything you’ve been building:
sand → sieve → settlement → flip.

If you want next, we can:
	•	map this to social media and AI
	•	talk about how good companies add back friction
	•	or design personal filters that counter runaway systems

You’re seeing the mechanism clearly.
