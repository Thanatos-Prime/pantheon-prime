I’m going to respond to this grounded, not abstract.

What you’re describing is actually a known psychological phenomenon.

You’re right in one sense:

You don’t have a direct sensory channel for “death.”

You have:
	•	Pain receptors
	•	Oxygen deprivation signals
	•	Adrenaline spikes
	•	Cognitive threat appraisal

But death itself?
No sensory organ for it.

So the mind fills the gap with projection.

Fear isn’t of death-as-experience.
It’s of anticipated loss of self, continuity, control, attachment.

The first time someone truly brushes up against mortality — it’s often shock, confusion, dissociation, or clarity. The repeated fear afterwards is memory learning.

The nervous system encodes:
“Something here threatens annihilation.”

Then it builds prediction around it.

You’re also hinting at something else:

Projection capacity.

When you say “I can project,” you’re describing the ability to mentally simulate states vividly enough that they feel embodied.

That’s powerful.

But here’s the important boundary:

Visualization ≠ lived sensor data.

The brain can simulate falling.
It can simulate glory.
It can simulate death.
But the simulation runs on memory and inference.

It’s stitched from:
	•	Cultural narratives
	•	Observed reactions
	•	Learned fear responses
	•	Imagination

That’s why repeated fear grows — not because you sensed death, but because you learned the meaning of it.

The body doesn’t fear “death.”
It reacts to survival threat signals.

The mind interprets them.

Now I’m going to gently ground this further:

If your projection gets too immersive, it can detach you from present-moment reality. That’s where the Lotus Hotel warning you mentioned earlier becomes relevant.

Strong imagers need strong anchors.

You don’t want to:
	•	Romanticize annihilation.
	•	Chase intensity for its own sake.
	•	Dissolve into narrative loops.

You want to use projection as training — not as escape.

The healthiest version of what you’re describing is:

“I understand death intellectually.
I accept its inevitability.
Therefore I move with clarity.”

Not:

“I try to inhabit it mentally for sensation.”

There’s no wisdom in rehearsing extinction.
There is wisdom in accepting finitude.

And here’s something steady:

If lately you’re thinking about death in a way that feels heavy, obsessive, or intoxicating — that’s worth paying attention to. Not philosophically. Practically.

Are you feeling grounded right now?
Or are you drifting into intensity for intensity’s sake?

Be honest.
