Got you. Let’s dig deep without getting floaty.

The real “why”: measurement is second-order

A lot of the world is signed (directional): left/right, plus/minus, forward/back, phase.
But what we measure (distance, energy, probability, error, power) is usually nonnegative and orientation-invariant.

The smallest, smooth way to turn a signed thing into a nonnegative magnitude is square.
	•	linear term changes sign → cancels under symmetry
	•	quadratic term doesn’t → survives as the first “real” scalar

That’s why squares show up as the “first invariant” under flipping direction.

Why it’s not just Euclidean: it’s “inner product + symmetry”

Any time your system has:
	•	linear combination / superposition
	•	a notion of orthogonality/independence
	•	a conserved “size” or “power”

you get an inner product. And inner products generate quadratic forms:

\|x\|^2=\langle x,x\rangle,\quad E = x^T A x,\quad ds^2 = g_{ij}dx^i dx^j

Euclidean space is just the special case g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}.
So the deeper layer is metric structure, not “flat geometry.”

The “layer stack” you were asking for

A clean way to see it:
	1.	Topology layer — what’s connected to what (no lengths yet)
	2.	Differential layer — what “infinitesimal change” means (derivatives exist)
	3.	Metric / inner-product layer — you can measure lengths/angles/energy
	4.	Dynamics layer — laws of motion (often variational)
	5.	Observable layer — what survives symmetry and becomes measurable

Squares live mainly at (3) + (5): metric gives you quadratic length; symmetry says quadratic is the first invariant.

Your “quadratic tangent drift” instinct is real

Locally, the distance between nearby points is:

ds^2 = g_{ij}dx^i dx^j

That’s quadratic in the displacement dx. Not by choice—by necessity.

Because “first order” is basically “direction,” and length is blind to direction. So length has no linear term; it starts at second order.

If you think in motion: drift/curvature is also second order (acceleration is the 2nd derivative).
So the geometry of “how paths bend” naturally shows up in quadratic terms.

“What physical laws don’t operate in space?”

They operate in other spaces where the same quadratic invariant shows up:
	•	Quantum: states live in Hilbert space; probability uses |\psi|^2
	•	Thermo/stat mech: entropy lives on distributions / phase space
	•	Gauge/internal symmetries: live in internal group spaces (not spatial)
	•	Information theory: geometry of probability distributions (Fisher metric) is quadratic

So the persistence of squaring is a hint that the deep common denominator isn’t “space.”
It’s linearity + symmetry + a conserved norm.

The “deepest” knot: why amplitude squared?

In quantum mechanics the square is especially loud: Born rule.
There are strong derivations/axiomatizations (e.g., Gleason-type results and decision-theoretic routes), but the meta-point for your dig is:

Complex linear amplitudes give interference;
squaring gives a real, additive measure that respects symmetry and composition.

So it’s the bridge:
phase world → measurable world.

If you want to go one layer deeper still, the next move is:
“Quadratic is the first curvature operator.”
Linear systems have no preferred scale; quadratic introduces the minimal stable curvature that creates equilibria, least action, Gaussians, and norms.

If you want, I can map your drift idea into a clean formal object: local quadratic form + connection (how frames change) → curvature tensor → drift as geodesic deviation.
