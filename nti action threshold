## 0. Purpose

The NTI Action Threshold Protocol is a reflection guide, not a control system. It answers: *“Given this NTI level and slope, what kind of inner questions are useful to ask?”*

It does not tell you what to do or override your sovereignty. It offers **questions**, not commands.

## 1. Threshold Bands & Reflection Prompts

### 1.1 NTI 0–10 — Dormant
**State:** Little to no narrative tension.
**Questions:**
* “Is this genuine rest, or avoidance?”
* “Is there anything I’ve been meaning to start?”
* “Is this a good time to recover or to plant seeds?”

### 1.2 NTI 10–25 — Warming
**State:** Early story formation.
**Questions:**
* “What story is beginning here?”
* “Who else is involved?”
* “What stakes might emerge if I continue down this path?”

### 1.3 NTI 25–40 — Building
**State:** Stable, healthy tension.
**Questions:**
* “What am I working toward?”
* “Are the stakes aligned with my values?”
* “What would ‘success’ look like here?”

### 1.4 NTI 40–55 — Elevated
**State:** Story is active, demands increasing.
**Questions:**
* “What pressure am I feeling most?”
* “Is this pressure chosen or imposed?”
* “What support or structure do I need?”

### 1.5 NTI 55–70 — Accelerating
**State:** Compression phase.
**Questions:**
* “What am I compressing toward?”
* “Is something important being neglected?”
* “Do I need to engage Praus (variance damping) or Bombadil (reset)?”

### 1.6 NTI 70–85 — High
**State:** Approaching breaking point.
**Questions:**
* “If this broke today, what would likely fail first?”
* “What would a graceful release look like?”
* “Am I ignoring any signals from my body or environment?”

### 1.7 NTI 85–100 — Critical
**State:** Act transition imminent (breakthrough or breakdown).
**Questions:**
* “What is the core choice here?”
* “What am I afraid to admit?”
* “What would it look like to protect the people I love in this moment?”
* “Is there a smaller, safer step I can take instead of an irreversible move?”

## 2. ΔNTI (Slope) Considerations

Overlay slope on top of level:

* **High NTI + Rapid Build** → Ask “What’s escalating?”
* **High NTI + Rapid Release** → Ask “What changed?”
* **Low NTI + Stable** → Ask “Is this rest or stagnation?”

## 3. Integration with PantheonOS

When NTI crosses certain boundaries, other modules may **offer** roles:

* **High NTI** → invite **Praus** (calm) and **Mirror** (clarity).
* **Rapid Build** → invite **Frogman** (what unknowns are driving this?).
* **Rapid Release** → invite **Mother Duck** (log the lesson).
* **Zero Cross** → invite **Bombadil** (set a new baseline).

**These are optional assists, never directives.**

## 4. Safety & Ethics

The protocol is designed to:
* Prevent reckless conflation of tension with “good” or “bad.”
* Encourage thoughtful self-inquiry.
* Keep agency firmly with the operator.
* Avoid exploitation of vulnerable highs or lows.

**It is always: Awareness before action.**
