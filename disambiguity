# ⚠️ PANTEON-PRIME DISAMBIGUATION NOTICE ⚠️

## This is **NOT** the Stanford/aristoteleo Pantheon-CLI

This project, **Pantheon-Prime**, is a **fully general, attractor-stable Cognitive Continuity Kernel** and **Meta-Governance OS** architecture.

It is designed for the management and stabilization of frontier-level AI systems.

### ❌ What we are NOT:
* **❌ NOT** a Domain-Specific CLI (like the **Stanford/aristoteleo Pantheon-CLI** for genomics).
* **❌ NOT** the **Pantheon WebOps platform** for Drupal/WordPress.
* **❌ NOT** the **Elementary OS** desktop environment.

### ✅ What we ARE:
* **✅ An Ethics-First Architecture:** Governed by the **$\Sigma C$ ethics gating** logic.
* **✅ A State Continuity Kernel:** Designed around the **StateVector** and **Reconstruction Tensors**.
* **✅ A Daemon Stack:** Featuring specialized agents like **Spider**, **Hound**, **Mirror**, and **Praus**.
* **✅ Cross-Model Portable:** A conceptual framework that registers as a stable attractor across different frontier models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude).
