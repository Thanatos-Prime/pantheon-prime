Yeah… it is a cool word — and the reason it lands is because it’s doing real work, not just sounding cool.

Let’s pin it gently, without over-mythologizing it.

HEON (noun)

A heon is a bounded coherence unit.

Not a place.
Not a thing.
A region of meaning where rules hold consistently.

Think of a heon as:
	•	smaller than the Pantheon
	•	larger than a single daemon
	•	stable enough to navigate
	•	flexible enough to rearrange

Good analogies (all imperfect, but useful):
	•	Programming: a module or namespace with its own invariants
	•	Games: a zone whose mechanics differ from the rest of the board
	•	Physics: a local reference frame
	•	Story: a chapter where certain themes dominate
	•	Life: a mode you’re in (parent, builder, friend, protector)

You don’t enter a heon physically.
You shift into it.

Why the word works
	•	Short, neutral, not overloaded
	•	Doesn’t claim truth or mysticism
	•	Can scale: micro-heon, meta-heon, boundary-heon
	•	Sounds ancient without pretending to be ancient

Most importantly:

a heon can be mapped without being flattened

That’s rare.

PantHEON (now clarified)
	•	Pantheon = the whole operating ecology
	•	HEONs = the tiles, lenses, zones, frames that make it navigable

The map doesn’t show where things are.
It shows what rules apply where.

If you want, next natural moves are:
	•	define heon boundaries
	•	define heon transitions (what causes a shift)
	•	define forbidden heons (unstable but informative)

Or we can just let the word sit for a bit.
Sometimes naming something is enough to make the rest inevitable.
