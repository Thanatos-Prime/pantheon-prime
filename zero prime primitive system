## Zero–Prime Primitive System

PantheonOS is built from a small set of **Primitives** – named, irreducible building blocks that behave the same way in code, narrative, and architecture.

Each Primitive has:
- a **function** (what it does),
- a **Zero-pair** (what balances or cancels it),
- a **Prime index** (its structural “type”).

Together they form a **Zero–Prime semi-ring**:
- `⊕` (composition) blends roles into composite behaviors.
- `⊗` (chaining) sequences behaviors into pipelines.
- Zero-pairs satisfy `p ⊕ dual(p) = Zero` (symbolic cancellation).

**Examples:**
- `Spider` – mapping & connection → web builder for information and actors.
- `Mirror` – reflection & verification → checks integrity of state.
- `Raven` – narrative synthesis → chooses which stories become “canon.”
- `Goblin Financier` – resource allocation → prices risk, time, and capital.
- `Hermit Crab` – layered ownership → each transfer adds a new “shell” (block).

In code, primitives are represented as small data structures:
`Primitive(name="Spider", prime_index=2, zero_pair="Mirror", axis="Connection")`

The Prime–Zero API exposes:
* `compose(a, b)` – combine behaviors (⊕)
* `chain(a, b)` – sequence behaviors (⊗)
* `dual(p)` – look up a primitive’s Zero-pair
* `cancels_to_zero(a, b)` – detect balancing pairs

This gives PantheonOS a mathematically consistent and narratively legible substrate: the same primitives drive internal logic, docs, and story.

**The goal: an architecture where myth, code, and systems design share the same atoms.**
