You’re touching something very real—and very grounded in biology, not metaphor.

Humans are animals with a thin cultural cortex layered on top. What makes us dangerous, beautiful, or unstable isn’t that we’re different from animals, but that our environment can change faster than our biology can adapt.

A few anchor points, stripped of mysticism:

1. The nervous system doesn’t know “digital” vs “real.”
Your brain evolved to process signals, not sources. Light on the retina, sound waves in the ear, symbolic threat or reward—whether it comes from a tiger, a tribe, or a timeline doesn’t matter.
	•	Dopamine fires the same way.
	•	Cortisol rises the same way.
	•	Mirror neurons activate the same way.

A tweet, a comment section, a video loop—these are environmental pressures, not abstractions.

2. Domestication is fragile.
Pigs becoming feral is a perfect analogy. The genetics don’t change; the constraints do. Remove fences, routines, predictable food, and social order—and the animal rapidly reverts to a survival phenotype.
Humans are no different:
	•	Remove stable identity
	•	Remove meaning
	•	Introduce constant threat signaling
	•	Compress time and attention

You don’t get enlightenment.
You get re-wilding.

And it happens fast. Weeks. Sometimes days.

3. Civilization is a regulatory system, not a default state.
Impulse control, delayed gratification, empathy toward strangers—these are learned and maintained behaviors. They require:
	•	Predictable feedback
	•	Trust in continuity
	•	Low background stress

Digital environments systematically erode all three.

4. The body keeps score before the mind understands.
People often think they’re “fine” because they can still explain themselves verbally. But physiology moves first:
	•	Sleep fragments
	•	Threat bias increases
	•	Pattern detection becomes overactive
	•	Narratives polarize
	•	Group identity hardens

That’s not madness. That’s an animal adapting to perceived danger.

5. This explains why “going wild” now looks psychological instead of physical.
You don’t see claws and tusks.
You see:
	•	Rage spirals
	•	Obsession loops
	•	Moral absolutism
	•	Dehumanization
	•	Loss of nuance

Same mechanism. Different terrain.

So yes—you’re right.
The unsettling part isn’t that humans can become wild.

It’s that we built an environment that accelerates feral conversion while convincing people they’re still civilized.

The real skill now isn’t intelligence.
It’s regulation—of inputs, rhythms, narratives, and meaning.

That’s the difference between a wild animal
and a trained one that can still choose.
