## 1. Core Identity

The 13th Coil represents:
* The shadow pressure in every decision
* The temptation loop
* The shortcut that breaks the arc
* The adversarial perspective
* The failure mode
* The blind spot
* The ego trap

**It is not a demon. It is not a metaphysical being. It is not an agent.**

It is the structural adversary used by PantheonOS to pressure-test decisions for resilience.

## 2. Function in PantheonOS

The 13th Coil reveals the weak point of every idea.

It identifies hidden assumptions, ego distortions, catastrophic edge cases, ethical weak points, narrative inconsistencies, time-bombs in decisions, adversarial interpretations, and vulnerabilities in logic.

Coil’s job is to ask the one question that breaks the solution—**so the solution becomes unbreakable.**
