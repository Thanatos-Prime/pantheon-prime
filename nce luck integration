# NCE × LUCK ENGINE INTEGRATION v3.0

**Subtitle:** Narrative Convergence drives probability gradients.  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 3.0

## 0. Core Formula

The Luck Engine v3.0:

$$L = S \times T \times V \times I(t)$$

Where: S = State, T = Timing, V = Vector, I(t) = Intuition.

**A Narrative Convergence Event boosts all four.**

## 1. NCE Multipliers

### 1.1 State $S$ ↑ during NCE formation
Internal clarity spikes. Dissonance resolves. Cognitive drag drops.

$$S_{\text{NCE}} = S_0 + \Delta S$$

### 1.2 Timing $T$ becomes razor-precise
NCEs are timing windows.

$$T_{\text{NCE}} = T_0 \cdot \kappa$$
($\kappa \in [1.2, 3.0]$)

### 1.3 Vector $V$ locks in
Before an NCE, multiple arcs compress → Direction becomes obvious.

$$V_{\text{NCE}} = V_0 + \Delta V$$

### 1.4 Intuition $I(t)$ peaks
Your intuition becomes near-lucid.

$$I_{\text{NCE}} \approx 0.9 - 1.0$$

## 2. Combined: NCE Global Luck Surge

During an NCE:

$$L_{\text{NCE}} \approx (1.3 - 3.5) \times L_{\text{baseline}}$$

Meaning: **Every action you take has massively amplified payoff.**

This is why breakthroughs cluster, timing hits, coincidences appear, people respond, and systems align.

**You’re surfing on a narrative probability wave.**
