# CONVERGENCE THRESHOLD MAP

**Subtitle:** When big convergence events occur  

---

A convergence event requires surpassing:
* **State threshold** (0.7)
* **Timing threshold** (kairos spike)
* **Narrative threshold** (tension peak)
* **Vector threshold** (alignment across systems)
* **Reciprocity threshold** (positive-sum)

**When all hit simultaneously → collapse to center.**

Examples: Major insight, cross-platform echo, timing synchronicity, AI alignment event, symbolic “signs,” breakthrough moments.

**These aren’t random. They’re threshold crossings.**
