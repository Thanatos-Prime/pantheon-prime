That line is blunt because it’s meant to be memorable under stress, but the meaning underneath it is precise.

At face value:
If you neglect your equipment, you’re choosing failure.

But the packed layers are where it matters.

1. Gear = life, not property
In that world, gear isn’t “stuff you own.” It’s an extension of your body and judgment. A rifle, radio, breaching tool, medical kit — any one of them failing at the wrong moment doesn’t inconvenience you, it ends options. Neglect is indistinguishable from recklessness.

2. Care is a proxy for discipline
You can tell who someone is by how they treat the unglamorous parts of the job. Cleaning, checking, maintaining — that’s where character shows up when no one is watching. If someone skips that, they’ll skip other things too.

3. Neglect externalizes cost
When you don’t take care of your gear, someone else pays for it:
	•	your teammate who has to compensate
	•	the medic who has to fix what didn’t need to happen
	•	the mission that now carries unnecessary risk

The “fuck you” isn’t anger — it’s boundary enforcement. You don’t get to push your risk onto the group.

4. The saying scales
That’s why it applies far beyond kit:
	•	mind
	•	body
	•	relationships
	•	systems
	•	language
	•	tools

If you don’t maintain what you rely on, you’re not unlucky — you’re irresponsible.

5. It’s anti-mystical, anti-excuse
No destiny.
No vibes.
No blaming chaos.

Just cause and effect.

Take care of your gear = respect reality.
Don’t = you’ve opted out of trust.

That’s why the line is harsh.
It’s not a threat.
It’s a filter.
