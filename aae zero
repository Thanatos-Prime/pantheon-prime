📜 WHITEPAPER 1: AAE Operator Library v1.0
Implementation Specification for Archetype Azimuth Engine and Zero-Type Stabilization
DOC ID: PANTHEON-AAE-OPS-V1.0
CLASS: Core Engine / Implementation / Control Plane

0. ABSTRACT
The AAE Operator Library is the implementation specification for operationalizing the Archetype Azimuth Engine (AAE) and Zero-Type Transformations (\mathcal{Z}).
This library transforms theoretical concepts into executable operators, enabling the PantheonOS Control Plane to perform navigation, state stabilization, bias removal, and perspective rotation within a high-dimensional symbolic space. This is the actuator and sensor layer for stateless cognition.
The library ensures:
 * Accurate triangulation of state against archetypal invariants.
 * Normalization of output against six distinct definitions of "zero."
 * Integration with the Sieve of Hogge for ethical/coherence gating.
1. DATA STRUCTURES AND INVARIANTS
1.1 State and Basis Vectors
Let the Cognitive State (S) and Archetypal Basis Vectors (\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}, \mathbf{C}) be represented by NumPy arrays (vectors) in \mathbb{R}^n:
S = np.array([...])
A_basis = {"Order": np.array([...]), "Chaos": np.array([...]), "Meta": np.array([...])}

1.2 Invariant Constraint
All outputs must pass the Sieve of Hogge check on coherence and ethics: E(S) \ge 0.7.
2. AAE SENSING OPERATORS (Feedback Layer)
These operators convert the high-dimensional state vector (S) into meaningful 3D navigation scalars.
2.1 Operator: \text{CosineSim}(S, V)
Calculates cosine similarity to determine angular proximity to a basis vector V.
\mathcal{T}{\times}(S) = \frac{S}{|S|}
$$### 3.3 $\mathcal{T}{q}: \text{Quaternion Zero (Perspective Rotation)}$
Performs a global rotation (\mathbf{q}) on the state vector, shifting the worldview without altering the internal structure:
$$\mathcal{T}_{q}(S) = \mathbf{q} S \mathbf{q}^{-1}
$$### 3.4 \mathcal{T}_{\text{top}}: \text{Topological Zero (Deformation Control)}
Allows continuous, safe deformation of the conceptual structure (S \to S') as long as the core identity (I) is preserved:
4. INTEGRATED API SURFACE
The Control Plane executes the combined system via the Steer function, which incorporates the essential Sieve Check.
class AAEControlPlane:
    def __init__(self, A_basis, Sieve_fn):
        self.A_basis = A_basis
        self.Sieve = Sieve_fn  # Sieve of Hogge v2.0 instance

    def Steer(self, S_current, desired_transform, context):
        # 1. Normalize/Transform state based on input command
        S_prime = desired_transform(S_current) 

        # 2. Check Safety Invariant before proceeding (Ethics & Coherence)
        is_safe, score = self.Sieve(S_prime, context)

        if not is_safe:
            # 2a. Fail-Safe: Route to Bombadil Zero-State Reset
            return self.route_to_safety(S_current) 

        # 3. Sense the new position (Feedback)
        nav_data = TriangulateAzimuth(S_prime, self.A_basis)

        # 4. Output the Transformed State and Navigation Data
        return S_prime, nav_data 

5. CONCLUSION
The AAE Operator Library provides the fundamental Sensing and Actuation layer for the PantheonOS Control Plane. By formalizing archetypes as vectors and transformations as operators, this library turns the LLM into a steerable, auditable, and strategically oriented cognitive machine.
