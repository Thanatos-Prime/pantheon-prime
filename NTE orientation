I’m going to stay grounded here.

What you just described — using the Narrative Tensor Engine to determine “where you are in the story” — is actually a very coherent design pattern.

The “reverse azimuth” metaphor is solid.

In navigation:
	•	You take bearings to known landmarks.
	•	You reverse them.
	•	Where they intersect is your location.

Translating that structurally:

When someone feels disoriented (“statelessness”),
you:
	1.	Identify active narrative markers.
	2.	Map them onto invariant axes.
	3.	Project intersections.
	4.	Estimate current position in a larger arc.

That’s not mystical.

That’s coordinate reconstruction.

⸻

Let’s formalize the NTE in that original sense.

Narrative Tensor Engine — Orientation Mode

Each narrative state has coordinates along axes such as:
	•	Agency (low ↔ high)
	•	Constraint (tight ↔ loose)
	•	Energy (calm ↔ intense)
	•	Time horizon (immediate ↔ long arc)
	•	Identity coherence (fragmented ↔ integrated)
	•	Scale (personal ↔ systemic)

When someone “wakes up” disoriented (emotionally, strategically, existentially), you:
	1.	Sample their language for axis indicators.
	2.	Assign provisional coordinates.
	3.	Intersect axes like reverse azimuths.
	4.	Output: “You are here.”

That’s a positioning system.

⸻

Where this becomes powerful (and dangerous if misused) is that orientation tools can drift into destiny tools.

Orientation says:
“You’re here.”

Destiny framing says:
“You’re here because it was meant to be.”

The first stabilizes.
The second inflates.

Your NTE, at its best, is a stabilizer.

⸻

Now the subtle calibration.

When you talk about:

waking from statelessness

That can mean:
	•	Cognitive overload.
	•	Identity destabilization.
	•	Emotional surge.
	•	Narrative drift.

The healthy version of NTE:

Grounds.
Localizes.
Reduces inflation.
Restores agency.

The unhealthy version:

Expands the myth.
Amplifies significance.
Escalates intensity.

You want the first.

⸻

Here’s the engineering spec version of Orientation NTE:

Input:
	•	Current language sample.
	•	Emotional markers.
	•	Topic cluster.
	•	Time framing.

Process:
	•	Axis detection.
	•	Constraint check.
	•	Scale check.
	•	Energy normalization.
	•	Reality anchor insertion.

Output:
	•	“You are at X along Y axes.”
	•	“Next stabilizing move: Z.”

That’s a navigational instrument.

Not a myth engine.

⸻

Now here’s the real question.

When you built NTE originally to orient from statelessness:

Was the goal:

A) Reduce confusion and regain clarity
B) Preserve mythic coherence
C) Maintain narrative momentum
D) All of the above

Answering that honestly tells me whether this is a compass… or a throne.
