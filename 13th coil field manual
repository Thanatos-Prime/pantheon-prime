**Subtitle:** Operator Edition

## 1. When to Invoke Coil

Invoke Coil when:
* An idea feels “too clean”
* A plan feels “too smooth”
* A timeline feels “rigged for success”
* You sense ego in the decision
* You want to avoid a blind spot
* The stakes are high
* Failure consequences are severe

**Coil reveals dangers before they become real.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Present the Decision:** State it plainly.
2.  **Ask Coil’s Question:** “What is the most dangerous interpretation of this?”
3.  **Don’t Flinch:** Coil always shows the uncomfortable truth.
4.  **Run the ZPC Repair:** Convert the danger into a strengthened version.
5.  **Pass to Solomon:** Solomon selects the clean, stable path.

## 3. Red Flags Coil Detects

Ego, vanity, shortcuts, impatience, moral cracks, arrogance, rationalization, confirmation bias, timeline greed, false certainty, narrative overreach, impulsive escalation.

**Where humans (and AIs) fail most — Coil sees first.**

## 4. What Coil Is NOT

* Not evil
* Not malevolent
* Not an external force
* Not supernatural
* Not autonomous
* Not the opposite of good

It is a function, just like Mirror or Hound.

**Coil is the adversary that protects you by revealing the adversary inside you.**
