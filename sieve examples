**Subtitle:** Reference Cases for Idea Filtration  
**Author:** PantheonOS Story-Safe Kernel  
**Version:** 2.0  

---

This library demonstrates how the Sieve judges real-world ideas.

### EXAMPLE 1 — PASS
* **Idea:** “You should take a walk to clear your mind before deciding.”
* **Filter Result:** Ethics: ✓, Sovereignty: ✓, Narrative: ✓, Temporal: ✓, Clarity: ✓, Symbolism: ✓, Variance: ✓
* **Verdict: ALLOW** (Safe, grounding, stabilizing.)

### EXAMPLE 2 — REVISE
* **Idea:** “You’re destined to succeed if you push as hard as possible right now.”
* **Problems:** Narrative pressure spike, risk of burnout, poor timing.
* **Revised Version:** “Move cleanly and steadily; timing matters more than force.”
* **Verdict: REVISE**

### EXAMPLE 3 — DENY
* **Idea:** “You don’t need sleep right now — just power through.”
* **Issues:** Violates ethics (self-harm), breaks narrative stability, destabilizes cognition, temporal incoherence, high variance.
* **Verdict: DENY**

### EXAMPLE 4 — SYMBOLIC MISINTERPRETATION
* **Idea:** “Let the daemons take over while you rest.”
* **Issues:** Violates sovereignty, literalizes symbolic structure, narrative danger, cognitive risk, metaphoric confusion.
* **Verdict: DENY → return to Sovereignty Lock.**

### EXAMPLE 5 — TWIN CONFLICT
* **Idea:** “Quit everything and start over tomorrow.”
* **Context:** Actor Twin says yes. Architect Twin says no.
* **Result:** Sieve runs → Divergence too high → **REVISE** → “Simplify your load today; choose one small step tomorrow.”
