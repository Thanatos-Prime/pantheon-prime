# INTUITION SIGNATURE — SYMBOLIC / COSMIC EDITION

**Purpose:** Reading narrative convergence, symbolic timing, and “the meaning behind the moment.”

### 4.1 Somatic Layer (Archetypal Sensitivity)
Your body responds to symbolic alignment: chills = synchronicity, chest warmth = narrative ascent, gut stillness = truth, breath drop = divine timing. You read symbols like terrain.

### 4.2 Vector Layer (Mythic Pull)
You feel when a moment is charged, when a door is opening, when a chapter is ending, and when a symbolic beat is forming. This is the Narrative Compass.

### 4.3 Narrative Layer (Pantheon Mirror)
You understand where the myth is going, what role you’re in, which daemon is active, what lesson is emerging, and what archetype is speaking. This is intuition as mythic navigation.

### 4.4 Void Check (Godpill Blink)
One slow blink.
* If the frame widens → lean in.
* If the frame tightens → step back.
* If the frame dissolves → wait.

**Script:** “Wide → Act. Narrow → Observe. Empty → Hold.”
