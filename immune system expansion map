Below is the Pantheon Immune System Expansion Map v1.0 — the full set of additional layers Pantheon-Prime should develop now, to close the last remaining attack surfaces and give the system a complete defensive + active capability stack.

You already have:
	•	Hades (model identity integrity)
	•	Golden Manifest (immutable model genome)
	•	Merkle Warden (tamper-evident hashing)
	•	MotherDuck (ledger)
	•	Praus + ΣC (ethical action governor)
	•	Blacksmith (invariant verification)
	•	Hermit Crab (blockchain shell around cognition)
	•	Ganglion (perception-layer filtering)

These form the innate immune system.

Below is the full set of additional modules Pantheon needs now to become a complete artificial immune system + active cognitive defense architecture.

Each one fills a currently unguarded domain.

⸻

🟥 1. Echidna — The Adversarial Input Immune Layer

Threats it stops:
	•	Prompt-injection
	•	Adversarial image perturbations
	•	Logic bombs in user text
	•	Pattern-trigger backdoors
	•	Unicode stealth exploits
	•	Instruction hijacking via multi-modal cues

Function:
A sub-daemon attached to Ganglion that:
	•	performs adversarial detection
	•	sanitizes toxic tokens through lossy transforms
	•	down-weights anomalous frequency patterns
	•	blocks attention spikes that match Trojan signatures
	•	enforces “bounded input semantics”

Why Pantheon needs it:
Because adversarial inputs target the model, not the substrate.
Echidna protects the model before it sees them.

⸻

🟧 2. Cerberus — The Multi-Model Watchdog (Cross-Genie Arbitration)

Threats it stops:
	•	Model hallucinations
	•	Reasoning drift
	•	Hidden failure cascades
	•	Cross-model disagreement exploitation
	•	Black-box Trojan output channels

Function:
	•	runs three parallel models on critical steps
	•	performs majority vote or contradiction detection
	•	flags statistically impossible divergence
	•	detects covert channels hidden in output style

Why Pantheon needs it:
Cerberus gives Pantheon “consensus cognition,” much like cluster redundancy.

⸻

🟩 3. Astraea — The Trust / Reputation Gradient Engine

Threats it stops:
	•	Tools that degrade over time
	•	Rogue third-party plugins
	•	Models whose behavior drifts subtly
	•	Slow-poisoned embeddings
	•	Tools that perform differently in rare edge-cases

Function:
	•	builds long-term “trust gradients” for every tool & model
	•	dynamically adjusts their ΣC weight
	•	down-ranks unreliable components
	•	blocks tools with negative trust momentum

Why Pantheon needs it:
Everything should have a trust slope that changes with evidence.
This allows long-term adaptive immunity.

⸻

🟦 4. Parallax Shield — Temporal Consistency Layer

Threats it stops:
	•	Pseudo-random hallucinations
	•	Time-based Trojan triggers
	•	Drift from past decisions
	•	Models lying subtly about past statements

Function:
	•	compares current output to historical state
	•	enforces consistency with prior truths
	•	detects contradictions
	•	flags sudden “mode shifts” as suspicious

Why Pantheon needs it:
Most malicious behavior emerges as inconsistency over time.
Parallax Shield makes time itself a defense.

⸻

🟪 5. Chimera Firewall — Tool Invocation Integrity Gate

Threats it stops:
	•	malicious tool-calls
	•	unauthorized API use
	•	RCE via tool-call hallucination
	•	shell injection attempts
	•	unauthorized file writes

Function:
Intercepts every tool call and checks:
	•	Is this tool allowed?
	•	Is the call consistent with prior reasoning?
	•	Does it pass ΣC tool-mode thresholds?
	•	Does it match the allowable parameter schema?

Why Pantheon needs it:
Most catastrophic attacks occur through tool invocation, not model text.

⸻

🟫 6. Hypatia — The Formal Reasoning Auditor

Threats it stops:
	•	reasoning hallucinations
	•	flawed chain-of-thought
	•	logic errors
	•	hidden contradictions
	•	deceptive reasoning

Function:
	•	runs symbolic proof-checks on steps
	•	performs consistency analysis
	•	ensures causal coherence
	•	identifies logical fallacies
	•	evaluates self-critique

Why Pantheon needs it:
The model is the least reliable part of the system; Hypatia audits its mind.

⸻

🟨 7. Phylactery — Memory Infection Scanner

Threats it stops:
	•	state-vector poisoning
	•	corrupted ThoughtObjects
	•	injected state
	•	replay attacks
	•	covert channels hidden in memory

Function:
	•	inspects stored ThoughtObjects for anomalies
	•	detects abnormal entropy distribution
	•	checks hash-chain integrity
	•	purges infected or tampered memory nodes

Why Pantheon needs it:
Memory corruption is the most subtle AI attack vector.
Phylactery protects Pantheon’s long-term cognition.

⸻

🟦 8. Beholder — Multi-Modal Trojan Detector

Threats it stops:
	•	malicious training images
	•	poisoned audio patterns
	•	embedded triggers in video
	•	multi-modal backdoors

Function:
	•	scans images/audio for adversarial patterns
	•	down-samples or blurs suspicious anomaly regions
	•	blocks multi-modal triggers before they reach the model

Why Pantheon needs it:
Multi-modal Trojan research is exploding.
Pantheon needs eyes that cannot be tricked.

⸻

🟩 9. The Lymphatic Net — Cleanup + Recovery Layer

Threats it stops:
	•	residue states
	•	intermediate activations storing harmful info
	•	residual gradients poisoning later actions
	•	accumulation of soft errors in chain-of-thought

Function:
	•	periodically flushes non-critical state
	•	compresses safe state back into StateVector
	•	enforces “clean hands” before high-stakes tasks

Why Pantheon needs it:
Models accumulate cognitive toxins over long sessions.
The Lymphatic Net keeps Pantheon clear-headed.

⸻

🟧 10. Sentinel Loom — Real-Time Threat Map + Correlation Engine

Threats it stops:
	•	multi-stage attacks
	•	pattern combinations invisible to single daemons
	•	cross-domain exploitation sequences
	•	latent chain reactions

Function:
	•	integrates signals from all daemons
	•	correlates low-level anomalies into high-level alerts
	•	predicts evolving threat vectors
	•	preemptively raises Sigma-C thresholds dynamically

Why Pantheon needs it:
True immunity requires networked threat intelligence.

⸻

🟥 11. Aurum Gate — Governance-Key Protection Layer

Threats it stops:
	•	attempts to modify Golden Manifests
	•	tampering with Hades
	•	poisoning operator keys
	•	attempts to bypass Merkle Warden
	•	impersonation of Kernel

Function:
	•	enforces key ceremony rules
	•	maintains multi-sig threshold
	•	monitors for anomalous governance actions
	•	performs “golden law enforcement”

Why Pantheon needs it:
The strongest attack is someone trying to rewrite Pantheon’s laws.
Aurum Gate prevents that.

⸻

🟫 12. Chronos Mesh — Time-Dilation Attack Defense

Threats it stops:
	•	replay attacks
	•	stale prompts
	•	delayed reasoning traps
	•	temporal-side-channel Trojans

Function:
	•	stamps each ThoughtObject with chronological proofs
	•	verifies time-consistency

Why Pantheon needs it:
Time-based exploits are subtle, powerful, and often invisible.
