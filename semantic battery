You’re basically describing how language becomes a compression engine, and you’re right about the mechanism—even if the way people talk about it sounds mystical.

Here’s the grounded version that keeps the power without drifting into woo.

⸻

Every word does act like an attractor — but not magically

A word is a pointer to a cloud:
	•	experiences
	•	memories
	•	emotions
	•	norms
	•	expectations
	•	implied actions

When someone hears a word, their brain doesn’t retrieve a definition — it activates a region of semantic space. That’s the “attractor” people are gesturing at.

Nothing supernatural there. It’s how associative memory works.

⸻

Why nouns beat verbs for compression

You nailed the key distinction.

Verbs
	•	Procedural
	•	Time-bound
	•	Already overloaded
	•	Harder to reprogram (“do,” “make,” “be,” “work”)

Verbs are execution rails. They resist reinterpretation.

Nouns
	•	Abstractable
	•	Container-like
	•	Can hold contradictions
	•	Can accumulate meaning over time

A noun can become a semantic battery.

That’s why:
	•	“Nation”
	•	“Freedom”
	•	“Justice”
	•	“God”
	•	“Market”
	•	“Security”

…carry insane power. They compress whole worldviews into a single token.

⸻

What density actually is (important)

Semantic density =

How much inference can be unpacked from a single symbol

High-density nouns let you:
	•	Skip explanation
	•	Coordinate groups
	•	Transmit values implicitly
	•	Move fast without restating premises

That’s compression, not manipulation.

⸻

Why pre-established words are harder

Once a word is:
	•	Institutionally defined
	•	Legally bound
	•	Emotionally polarized

…it becomes stiff. You can’t load it much more without it cracking.

That’s why new frameworks tend to:
	•	Coin terms
	•	Repurpose obscure words
	•	Use metaphorical nouns
	•	Build names before actions

It creates clean containers with low semantic noise.

⸻

What you’re actually doing with the Pantheon (clean framing)

Stripped of myth language, the Pantheon is doing this:
	•	Creating high-density nouns
	•	That bundle:
	•	constraints
	•	heuristics
	•	ethics
	•	roles
	•	failure modes
	•	So complex reasoning can be referenced cheaply and consistently

That’s not exotic.

That’s:
	•	Mathematics (e.g. “group,” “field,” “tensor”)
	•	Law (“precedent,” “standing,” “jurisdiction”)
	•	Engineering (“interface,” “invariant,” “protocol”)
	•	Military doctrine (“center of gravity,” “kill chain”)

All of those are nouns doing heavy lifting.

⸻

Why this feels powerful (and why people get uneasy)

Two reasons:
	1.	Compression looks like authority
If you can say less and mean more, people assume dominance.
	2.	Shared attractors synchronize thinking
Groups with dense shared symbols move faster than groups constantly renegotiating meaning.

That speed can be used well or badly — which is why societies are nervous about it.

⸻

The non-negotiable constraint (this matters)

High-density symbols must stay bounded.

When a noun:
	•	Claims universality
	•	Refuses falsification
	•	Absorbs all counterexamples
	•	Replaces reality instead of pointing to it

…it stops being compression and becomes semantic gravity.

That’s how religions, ideologies, and cults fail.

The difference between a tool and a trap is whether the symbol still points outward.

⸻

The clean summary

Words are not magic.
They are lossy compression codecs for shared cognition.
Nouns are the highest-bandwidth containers we have.
Power comes from density plus boundaries.

If you want next, we can:
	•	Formalize this as a semantic compression model
	•	Talk about how to test whether a noun is becoming a trap
	•	Or map how to deliberately design high-density terms without myth inflation

You’re seeing a real mechanism.
Just keep it engineered, not enchanted.
