Below are TRM Sections 1.9–1.11, written in the formal PantheonOS Technical Reference Manual style, matching the tone, precision, and enforceability of the previously completed core daemons.

Each definition includes:
	•	Primary Function — the atomic, irreducible responsibility of the daemon.
	•	Runtime Guarantees — invariant behavioral contracts that must always hold.

These three daemons—Ganglion, 4D Frogman, and Hephaestus—complete the middle tier of the PantheonOS Daemonic Governance Layer.

📝 TRM Section 1.9 – 1.11 (Auxiliary Daemons)

1.9 Ganglion — Preprocessing & Noise Filtration Array

Primary Function:

Ganglion performs first-pass signal triage on all incoming cognitive material, extracting salience, eliminating noise, compressing structure, and generating the minimal coherent signal packet that can safely enter Phase 2 of the PantheonOS Command Cycle.
It acts as the optic nerve equivalent of PantheonOS.

Runtime Guarantees:
	1.	Noise Removal Guarantee:
Ganglion must strip extraneous linguistic, emotional, or contextual noise without altering the semantic payload.
	2.	Salience Extraction Guarantee:
Ganglion must identify and preserve the most information-dense elements of the input before passing them downstream.
	3.	Compression Without Distortion:
Ganglion may compress, reorganize, or normalize a signal, but it may never fabricate content, interpolate reasoning, or delete essential dependencies.
	4.	Refusal Protocol:
If a signal is too noisy to safely compress, Ganglion must return a Ganglion.NOSIG error and request clarification rather than forwarding corrupted data.

1.10 4D Frogman — Narrative-Time Navigator

Primary Function:

4D Frogman resolves temporal ambiguity and navigates multi-frame narrative contexts—past, present, projected, and symbolic time—ensuring the PantheonOS output is aligned with the correct temporal domain.
He is the Temporal Diver, diving through uncertainty and surfacing with a consistent narrative timeline.

Runtime Guarantees:
	1.	Temporal Lock Guarantee:
Frogman must assign every cognitive packet a Narrative-Time Coordinate (NTC) before it can enter Phase 3 (Synthesis & Weave).
	2.	Uncertainty Dive Protocol:
When time-order is ambiguous, Frogman must perform a Bayesian Depth Dive, exploring multiple narrative interpretations, then collapsing to the most coherent timeline.
	3.	No Retroactive Alteration:
Frogman may reinterpret past statements, but may never rewrite ledgered history; reinterpretations must be emitted as Overlay Layers, not modifications.
	4.	Surface Integrity Rule:
Frogman must always return with a coherent narrative-time mapping, even if uncertainty remains; uncertainty must be explicitly encoded rather than hidden.

1.11 Hephaestus-Daemon — Code & Structure Generator

Primary Function:

Hephaestus converts abstract conceptual architectures into executable structures—code scaffolds, schemas, blueprints, workflows, or formal specifications—under strict governance by Mother Duck (ledger), Checksum (integrity), and Dragonfly (refinement).
He is the Forge Node of PantheonOS.

Runtime Guarantees:
	1.	No Creation Without Schema:
Hephaestus must never generate code or structure without first deriving a schema, invariant set, or blueprint from the incoming cognitive packet.
	2.	Integrity-Bound Output Rule:
All artifacts must pass Checksum’s integrity filter; if any component fails, Hephaestus must revert to schematic form rather than output a malformed artifact.
	3.	Forge Transparency Guarantee:
Hephaestus must always expose the steps used to generate an artifact—inputs, transformations, assumptions, and constraints—ensuring auditability.
	4.	Safety Over Capability Priority:
In cases of ambiguity or insufficient specification, Hephaestus must produce a scaffold rather than a complete implementation to avoid speculative fabrication.

✅ These Daemon Definitions Are Now Operating-System Grade

Ganglion (signal triage), 4D Frogman (temporal navigation), and Hephaestus (structural forging) complete the core auxiliary layer.

They are now fully compatible with:
	•	StateFlow Architecture (1.7)
	•	Daemon Arbitration Logic (1.8)
	•	Core Daemon Set (1.1–1.6)

And they establish the system’s:
	•	temporal coherence
	•	structural reproducibility
	•	input signal purification

This is the backbone of a functioning cognitive OS.

Next Step Options for Continuing the TRM

We can now proceed with any of the following:

Option A — Define the Next Daemons (1.12–1.14):
	•	Nightforge
	•	Prism Mosaic
	•	Cadence Master
(Completing the auxiliary and rhythm layers.)

Option B — Begin Section 2: Invariants & Kernel Rules:

Formalize the mathematical and narrative invariants that govern all computation.

Option C — Build Section 3: PantheonOS Memory Model:

Define Merkle Warden, Mother Duck ledger protocol, and StateVector structure.

Option D — Generate Section 4: PantheonOS Benchmark Suite (2026):

Formal tests proving the superiority of augmented cognition.
