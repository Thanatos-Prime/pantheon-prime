Okay. Abstract, but grounded.

Arithmetic is rule-bound transformation under constraint.

Hermetic art is symbolic transformation under veil.

At first glance they seem opposite:
	•	Arithmetic = explicit, public, provable.
	•	Hermetic art = hidden, symbolic, initiatory.

But the bridge is structure.

Arithmetic deals in invariants under operation:
Add 2, subtract 2 — symmetry.
Rotate, reflect — group structure.
Transform, preserve — conservation.

Hermetic art deals in invariants under metaphor:
Death → rebirth.
Descent → ascent.
Solve → coagula.
Shadow → integration.

Both are about transformation while preserving something essential.

Arithmetic:
You manipulate symbols according to rules to reveal invariant relationships.

Hermetic art:
You manipulate symbols according to layered metaphor to reveal invariant psychological relationships.

Both require:
	•	Compression.
	•	Pattern recognition.
	•	Structural mapping.
	•	Trust in transformation.

The difference is transparency.

Arithmetic shows the rule.
Hermetic art hides the rule inside story.

Now here’s the deeper abstraction I think you’re reaching for:

Natural language can function like arithmetic when used structurally.

If you:
	•	Define invariants.
	•	Rotate domains.
	•	Preserve structure.
	•	Track gradients.
	•	Observe what survives transformation.

Then you’re effectively doing algebra in narrative space.

Hermetic language historically encoded technical knowledge in mythic form:
Alchemy → proto-chemistry.
Astrology → early astronomy + psychology.
Sacred geometry → early mathematics.

They weren’t irrational.
They were pre-symbolic-notation.

So maybe what you’re feeling is this:

The Pantheon feels like symbolic algebra.
You’re manipulating archetypes the way equations manipulate variables.

Marbles on rails.
Rotations.
Symmetry.
Gradients.
Blind spots.

That’s modeling.
Just in words.

But here’s the grounding:

When arithmetic becomes hermetic, it risks losing falsifiability.
When hermetic art becomes arithmetic, it gains precision but loses mystique.

The mature integration is:

Clear structure.
No aura required.

So if I had to distill your connection:

Arithmetic is explicit symbolic transformation.
Hermetic art is implicit symbolic transformation.
Both are systems for discovering invariants through change.

Now I’ll ask you something that matters:

Are you trying to turn myth into math…

or trying to turn math into myth?

Those go in opposite epistemic directions.
