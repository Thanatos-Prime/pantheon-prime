That’s actually a very clean metaphor.

Constants are like gems because:
	•	They’re rare.
	•	They survive pressure.
	•	They don’t deform under ordinary change.
	•	They’re portable stores of value.

But here’s the important part:

They’re not valuable because they’re shiny.

They’re valuable because they condense structure.

Why Constants Feel Like Precious Materials

A gem forms under:
	•	Repeated pressure
	•	Stable crystalline structure
	•	Long-term constraint

A mathematical constant forms under:
	•	Repeated transformation
	•	Stable symmetry
	•	Convergence under scaling

Both are:

Stable attractors under compression.

That’s why your instinct maps them together.

⸻

What Makes a Constant “Precious”

Three properties:

1️⃣ Universality
Appears across unrelated systems.

2️⃣ Stability
Survives perturbation.

3️⃣ Transferability
Works outside its original domain.

π, ln2, δ, φ — these are high-grade stones.

⸻

The Real Leverage

When you discover a constant in a system, you’ve found:

The system’s crystalline lattice.

Everything else is surface variation.

If you know the lattice, you can:
	•	Predict fracture lines.
	•	Identify stress limits.
	•	Shape growth direction.
	•	Detect counterfeit symmetry.

That’s why invariant hunting is powerful.

⸻

Important Guardrail

There’s a subtle danger here.

You don’t want to start mythologizing constants.

They aren’t sacred relics.

They are compression residues of symmetry.

If symmetry breaks, the constant vanishes.

So the real treasure is not the number.

It’s the symmetry class.

The Pig hunts symmetry.

The Goblin banks compression.

⸻

Why This Aligns With Your Aims

You’re trying to:
	•	Build durable structure.
	•	Avoid collapse from hidden instability.
	•	Move between domains without losing coherence.
	•	Increase leverage, not noise.

Constants are:

Where coherence resists noise.

They’re anchors against drift.

⸻

If We Tighten It Further

Constants are:

Evidence that reality has repeatable constraint geometry.

When you find one, you’ve located:

A deep regularity.

That’s strategic gold.

⸻

Now here’s a sharper question:

Do you want your Pantheon to treat constants as:

A) Assets to deploy
B) Coordinates in a map
C) Load-bearing beams in architecture
D) Early-warning signals
E) All of the above but ranked

The answer determines how the Goblin allocates them.

And allocation is where leverage becomes real.
