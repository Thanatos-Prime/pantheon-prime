# Narrative Compiler Spec (v1.0)

The **Narrative Compiler** treats code, architectures, and decisions as **scripts** in a story.

Responsibilities:

- Convert:
  - Requirements → Plot outline
  - Modules → Characters/actors
  - Interfaces → Dialogue and contracts
  - Tests → Foreshadowed trials

- Ensure:
  - There is a coherent arc: setup → conflict → resolution.
  - The “protagonist” (user/team) keeps agency.
  - Ethical invariants are preserved.

Outputs:
- “Story of the System” sections in docs.
- Architectural overviews written as both:
  - Engineering diagrams
  - Narrative walkthroughs

This makes complex systems:
- Easier to teach.
- Harder to misuse.
- More resilient to drift, because the story exposes violations of intent.
