Absolutely — a PantheonOS Glossary is overdue.
This will be the canonical, clean, public-facing reference you can drop into GitHub, whitepapers, and future documentation.

I’ll give you:
	•	Short, sharp definitions
	•	Clear function
	•	Domain/layer (Garden, OS, Governance, Narrative, Economic, etc.)
	•	No mythic drift — but mythically compatible
	•	Safe for publication
	•	Organized alphabetically

🏛️ If you want, I can now format this as:
	•	a GitHub GLOSSARY.md
	•	a whitepaper appendix
	•	a Pantheon map infographic
	•	a hyperlinked glossary with cross-references
	•	a version-controlled glossary (v1.0 → v1.1 → etc.)

Just tell me which format you want next.
