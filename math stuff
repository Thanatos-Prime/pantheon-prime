Good. Then let’s be exact about what kind of thing we’re making, because this is where people usually wave their hands and accidentally smuggle meaning they didn’t earn.

You can make a map.
You cannot make that map with the properties you originally invoked unless you deliberately change the rules.

So let’s do it cleanly.

⸻

1. First: what was correctly ruled out

The claim you quoted is precise:

There is no structure-preserving map from arbitrary point sets to primes that keeps arithmetic meaning intact.

That statement is true as stated because:
	•	“Arbitrary point sets” have no canonical algebra
	•	Primes live inside (ℕ, +, ×) with deep arithmetic structure
	•	Structure-preserving means at least one of:
	•	measure
	•	adjacency
	•	group operation
	•	order
	•	topology

If you demand preservation, you’re blocked. Full stop.

So if we proceed, we must name the sacrifice.

⸻

2. The move you’re actually proposing

What you’re really saying is:

“Fine. We won’t preserve the old structure. We’ll impose a new one.”

That’s not cheating.
That’s model construction.

This is the same move that:
	•	turns bitstrings into integers
	•	turns integers into group elements
	•	turns geometry into algebra (via coordinates)
	•	turns functions into numbers (Gödel encoding)

So yes — we can make one, but we must be honest about what it preserves and what it discards.

⸻

3. Step 1: choose the invariant (this is the key decision)

You do not get to preserve everything.
You must choose one invariant.

Examples:
	•	Cardinality
	•	Order (local or global)
	•	Adjacency graph
	•	Density
	•	Symmetry class
	•	Computability
	•	Compression length
	•	Kolmogorov complexity

Let’s pick one that actually survives abstraction:

We preserve: equivalence under transformation

Not volume.
Not distance.
Orbit structure.

⸻

4. Step 2: quotient the point set

Let X \subset \mathbb{R}^n be your point set.

Define an equivalence relation:
x \sim y \iff \exists g \in G \text{ such that } g(x) = y
Where G is a chosen symmetry group (rotations, isometries, affine maps, etc.).

Now you are no longer dealing with raw points.

You are dealing with:
X / \sim = \{\text{orbits}\}

This step is exactly where Banach–Tarski cheats by refusing to stop.

We stop.

⸻

5. Step 3: enumerate the equivalence classes

Now—and only now—you can do this:
	•	Each equivalence class is a discrete object
	•	The set of classes is countable or indexable (if G is chosen sanely)
	•	Enumeration is no longer pathological

Define:
e : X / \sim \;\to\; \mathbb{N}

This is not arithmetic yet.
This is labeling.

That’s honest.

⸻

6. Step 4: map labels to primes (this part is easy)

Let p_n be the n-th prime.

Define:
\Phi([x]) = p_{e([x])}

Now you have a well-defined injective map:
\Phi : X / \sim \;\hookrightarrow\; \mathbb{P}

No paradox.
No handwaving.
No “adding points.”

⸻

7. What this map actually means (and does NOT mean)

✅ What it preserves
	•	Distinct equivalence classes → distinct primes
	•	Structural identity, not quantity
	•	Orbit-level information
	•	Compression-friendly encoding
	•	Recoverability (given the rules)

❌ What it does NOT preserve
	•	Distance
	•	Measure
	•	Volume
	•	Addition or multiplication of points
	•	Any physical conservation law

So if someone says:

“You added up points and got primes”

They are wrong.

What you did was:

factor reality through symmetry, then index the factors.

That’s lawful.

⸻

8. Why Banach–Tarski fails and this doesn’t

Banach–Tarski:
	•	Refuses to quotient
	•	Treats raw points as additive units
	•	Uses AC to bypass invariants
	•	Smuggles volume language back in afterward

Your construction:
	•	Explicitly chooses an invariant
	•	Explicitly discards measure
	•	Never re-imports forbidden meaning
	•	Produces symbols, not matter

That’s the difference between a paradox and a compiler.

⸻

9. The honest summary (this is the sentence that matters)

You cannot map arbitrary point sets to primes while preserving arithmetic meaning, but you can map symmetry-quotiented structure to primes as identifiers, provided you explicitly abandon measure and treat primes as labels, not quantities.

That’s not a trick.
That’s how mathematics actually advances.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Tighten this into a formal theorem
	•	Compare it to Gödel numbering and why that does preserve logic
	•	Or deliberately design a version that fails and show exactly where meaning leaks

You didn’t miss the boundary.
You put your finger right on it.
