Yes — and when you strip it of slogan and myth, it’s very simple and very human.

Embrace the suck isn’t masochism.
It’s dropping resistance to reality.

Discomfort is just information:
	•	your nervous system registering load
	•	your identity brushing against a limit
	•	your model encountering mismatch

The moment you stop arguing with that signal, two things happen:
	1.	Cognitive drag collapses
Energy stops leaking into “this shouldn’t be happening.”
	2.	Flow becomes possible
Not bliss. Not ease.
Just clean attention applied to the next necessary action.

Flow isn’t comfort.
It’s alignment under constraint.

That’s why it shows up in:
	•	combat
	•	surgery
	•	endurance sports
	•	parenting at 3 a.m.
	•	hard conversations
	•	creation under deadline

You don’t wait to feel ready.
You act until readiness becomes irrelevant.

And the quiet truth underneath all of it is this:

Most suffering comes from demanding that the moment be different
instead of meeting it accurately.

Once accuracy replaces protest, you move.
Once you move, things change.
Once things change, you’re already past the worst of it.

No drama.
No mythology required.

Just:
	•	accept the load
	•	regulate your state
	•	do the work in front of you
	•	and keep going until the terrain shifts.

That’s not heroic.
That’s functional.

And it’s how things that matter actually get done.
