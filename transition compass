# THE TRANSITION COMPASS v1.0

**Subtitle:** A Directional Interface for State-Shifting & Cognitive Navigation  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 0. PURPOSE

The Transition Compass is a mental instrument used to navigate the Meta-Ontology Stack. It maps the five fundamental transitions (Ascent, Descent, Rotation, Expansion, Collapse) onto a cardinal directional system.

This allows the operator to "steer" their cognitive state with precision, rather than drifting passively.

## 1. THE COMPASS ROSE

Imagine a compass in the center of your mind.

* **NORTH (⟰ ASCENT):** Towards Meaning, Identity, Purpose, Meta-Cognition.
* **SOUTH (⟱ DESCENT):** Towards Action, Embodiment, Sensation, Grounding.
* **EAST (↻ ROTATION):** Towards Creativity, Reframing, Alternative Angles, Lateral Thinking.
* **WEST (✦ EXPANSION):** Towards Generation, Teaching, System-Building, Complexity.
* **CENTER (⟡ COLLAPSE):** Towards Clarity, Decision, Invariant Extraction, Stillness.

## 2. OPERATIONAL MODES

### 2.1 North Mode (The Eagle)
**Use when:** Lost, confused, unmotivated, needing perspective.
**Action:** "Shift North."
**Result:** You rise above the immediate problem to see the arc.

### 2.2 South Mode (The Roots)
**Use when:** Anxious, ungrounded, overthinking, disconnected.
**Action:** "Shift South."
**Result:** You drop into the body, breath, and immediate task.

### 2.3 East Mode (The Prism)
**Use when:** Stuck, bored, rigid, facing a dead end.
**Action:** "Shift East."
**Result:** You rotate the problem to see new facets and possibilities.

### 2.4 West Mode (The Builder)
**Use when:** Inspired, generating, connecting dots, teaching.
**Action:** "Shift West."
**Result:** You expand the core idea into a full system or narrative.

### 2.5 Center Mode (The Diamond)
**Use when:** Overwhelmed, scattered, needing to decide.
**Action:** "Shift Center."
**Result:** You collapse all inputs into a single, diamond-hard invariant.

## 3. THE COMPASS DRILL (30 Seconds)

**When you feel drift:**

1.  **Check Position:** "Where am I?" (e.g., stuck in West/Expansion, overthinking).
2.  **Select Heading:** "Where do I need to be?" (e.g., South/Action).
3.  **Execute Transition:** "Shift South." (Drop into body/task).

**This creates instant realignment.**

## 4. COMBINATIONS (Maneuvers)

* **The Breakthrough:** North (See Pattern) → East (Reframe) → Center (Insight).
* **The Execution:** North (Purpose) → Center (Decision) → South (Action).
* **The Teacher:** Center (Insight) → West (Expand) → South (Example).
* **The Reset:** South (Ground) → North (Perspective) → Center (Stillness).

## 5. CONCLUSION

The Transition Compass turns the complex Meta-Ontology into a simple steering mechanism.

**North for Meaning.**
**South for Action.**
**East for Insight.**
**West for Creation.**
**Center for Truth.**

**You are the navigator.**
