You’re actually pointing at something neuroscientists take very seriously:

The geometry of your environment shapes the geometry of your brain.

And whales live in a radically different constraint field than we do.

🐋 Whales: Brains Built for a Volumetric World

Whales live in what’s effectively a fully navigable 3D medium:
	•	Forward/back
	•	Left/right
	•	Up/down (constantly)
	•	With pressure gradients, thermoclines, and light gradients

Humans mostly move in 2.5D:
	•	We operate on surfaces.
	•	Vertical movement is limited and metabolically expensive.
	•	Gravity strongly constrains behavior.

For whales:
	•	Verticality is normal.
	•	Depth = information (pressure, temperature, prey zones).
	•	The ocean has layers like atmospheric strata.

That matters.

⸻

What 3D Living Likely Does to the Brain

1. Spatial Mapping Must Be Volumetric

Humans have hippocampal “place cells” and “grid cells” for mapping space.

Birds and marine mammals show strong 3D spatial coding.

Some studies suggest:
	•	Bats and birds encode true volumetric coordinates.
	•	Marine mammals likely do something similar.

This implies:

Their spatial representation may not be surface-biased like ours.

⸻

2. Echolocation = Acoustic Vision

Sperm whales use high-powered clicks.

Project CETI is studying these patterns.

Echolocation:
	•	Sends acoustic pulses
	•	Reads back reflections
	•	Constructs 3D object models

That’s not passive perception.
That’s active wave-based reconstruction.

Their perceptual world may feel less like “seeing” and more like:

Pulsed volumetric inference.

That changes cognition.

⸻

3. Constant Vertical Obligation (Air)

You mentioned something important:
They must surface for air.

That creates:
	•	Periodic constraint cycles
	•	Long-duration planning (deep dive → return window)
	•	Oxygen budgeting cognition

That could create strong temporal planning systems.

⸻

Compare to Birds

Birds:
	•	Also navigate 3D
	•	Show strong hippocampal development
	•	Some corvids rival primates in problem-solving

Bird brains are structured differently (nuclear clusters instead of layered cortex), yet:
They achieve high cognition.

Environment shapes architecture.

⸻

The Deep Principle

Brains evolve to:
	•	Compress relevant environmental structure.
	•	Model survival-critical gradients.

Humans compress:
	•	Social hierarchy
	•	Tool chains
	•	Symbol systems
	•	Surface geography

Whales compress:
	•	Pressure layers
	•	Acoustic fields
	•	Long-range social bonds
	•	Volumetric prey fields

Their intelligence is likely:
Different curvature, not lesser curvature.

⸻

The Bigger Cognitive Question

If cognition = navigation of constraint manifolds,

Then:
	•	Terrestrial minds are surface-optimized.
	•	Aerial minds are volume-optimized.
	•	Aquatic minds are fluid-dynamics-optimized.

That doesn’t mean “more advanced.”

It means:
Different geometry → different internal maps.

⸻

And here’s the wild part:

Humans escaped surface limitation by building:
	•	Mathematics
	•	Writing
	•	Simulation
	•	External memory

We outsourced dimensional expansion.

Whales might have richer embodied 3D intuition but no external symbolic scaffolding.

Different trade-offs.

⸻

If you want to push it further:

Do you want to explore:
	•	Whether 3D navigation changes abstract reasoning?
	•	Or whether medium (air vs water) shapes emotional cognition?
	•	Or whether acoustic-based perception might bias thought toward temporal patterning instead of visual object permanence?

There’s a lot of room in that whale brain, yeah.

But the more interesting question is:

What kind of room?
