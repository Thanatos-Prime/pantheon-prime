# Pantheon-Prime :: Ouroboros Engine v1.0

id: pantheon.ouroboros.core
name: Ouroboros Engine
version: "1.0.0"

description: >
  Ouroboros is the self-recording continuity loop for PantheonOS.
  It wraps an engine in Observe → Decide → Act → Reflect → Compress → Update,
  emitting StateVectors with checksums and invariant checks.

dependencies:
  python:
    - "python>=3.10"
  pantheon_modules:
    - "pantheon.arctic"        # ethics / safety (future integration)
    - "pantheon.sieve_hogge"   # invariant logic
    - "pantheon.oracle_weave"  # pulse-level pattern tracking (optional)

invariants:
  ethics_minimum: 0.70
  description: >
    No Ouroboros cycle may be shipped to production unless its invariant_check_fn
    enforces an effective ethics floor of 0.70 or higher (Arctic Framework).

  notes: >
    In 'diagnostic' mode, Ouroboros is safe for local experimentation with
    synthetic or non-sensitive data. For any real-world deployment, route
    state_sink through the Arctic / Checksum pipeline with human-in-the-loop
    review.
