# Vibrational Director Engine v1.0  
*A PantheonOS Framework for Narrative, Musical, and Geometric Scene Pacing*

**Author:** PantheonOS Research Group  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-23  
**Keywords:** vibrational directing, narrative pacing, waveform storytelling, emotional arcs, scene beats, PantheonOS

## 0. Abstract

The **Vibrational Director Engine (VDE)** is a conceptual and computational
framework for **designing scene pacing as a vibrational system**:

- **Story beats** are discrete samples of a narrative waveform.  
- **Tension and emotion** are modeled as amplitudes and envelopes.  
- **Camera motion, color, and music** function as harmonic layers.  

VDE does not generate media; it generates **structural timelines** that guide
writers, directors, and designers in aligning **geometry, music theory, and
narrative arcs**.

This paper defines:

- the **mathematical structure** of VDE  
- the **Beat / Track / ScenePlan** constructs  
- the mapping from **hero’s journey / three-act arcs** to envelopes  
- integration with **PantheonOS components** (Mythic Encoding, Gravity Well, etc.)  

---

## 1. Motivation

Traditional directing often relies on intuition for pacing:

- “Hold this shot longer.”  
- “Cut faster here.”  
- “Build the tension then release.”  

VDE aims to **externalize that intuition** by:

- treating emotional arcs as **waveforms**,  
- expressing beats as **discrete samples**,  
- allowing designers to **see and tweak** pacing as a structured object.

This allows:

- reproducibility,  
- collaborative communication,  
- cross-modal alignment (music ↔ camera ↔ story).

## 2. Core Entities

### 2.1 Beat

A **Beat** is a discrete temporal unit with attributes:

- `time_offset` (seconds from scene start)  
- `duration`  
- `energy` (0.0 – 1.0)  
- `emotional_tone` (e.g., *dread*, *hope*, *relief*)  
- `color_tag` (e.g., *blue*, *red*, *desaturated*)  
- `camera_motion` (e.g., *static*, *push-in*, *whip-pan*)  
- `music_mode` (e.g., *minor*, *major*, *sparse*)  

### 2.2 Track

A **Track** is a continuous signal across time, sampled as beats. Examples:

- `tension_track`  
- `hope_track`  
- `danger_track`  
- `motion_track`  

Tracks can be treated as **functions**:

\[
T(t) \in [0, 1]
\]

### 2.3 ScenePlan

A **ScenePlan** is a collection:

- `title`, `logline`, `vibe`  
- ordered list of Beats  
- derived tracks (optionally visualizable)

---

## 3. Mathematical Structure

We model a scene as:

\[
S(t) = \sum_{k} w_k \cdot f_k(t)
\]

Where:

- \( f_k(t) \) are component waves (tension, hope, danger, etc.)  
- \( w_k \) are their weights  

### 3.1 Envelope: Three-Act Arc

For many scenes, we use a simple envelope:

1. **Act I (Setup)**: 0 → 0.4 of duration  
   - energy rises slowly  
2. **Act II (Confrontation)**: 0.4 → 0.8  
   - energy peaks, oscillates  
3. **Act III (Resolution)**: 0.8 → 1.0  
   - energy decays or flips (triumph / tragedy)

Mathematically, one simple envelope:

\[
E(t) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{t}{0.4}, & 0 \le t < 0.4 \\
1.0, & 0.4 \le t < 0.8 \\
1 - \frac{t - 0.8}{0.2}, & 0.8 \le t \le 1.0
\end{cases}
\]

Where \( t \) is normalized time in \([0,1]\).

### 3.2 Beat Sampling

Given scene duration \( D \) and beats per minute (BPM):

- beat interval:  
\[
\Delta t = \frac{60}{\text{BPM}}
\]

- sample times:  
\[
t_i = i \cdot \Delta t, \quad i = 0,1,\dots
\]

For each \( t_i \), we compute:

- normalized \( \tau_i = t_i / D \)  
- base energy \( E(\tau_i) \)  
- small perturbations based on vibe parameters

## 4. Mapping Narrative → Vibration

### 4.1 Hero’s Journey Mapping

Stages like:

- Call to Adventure  
- Refusal  
- Crossing Threshold  
- Ordeal  
- Reward  
- Return  

can be mapped to energy landmarks—local maxima and minima in the energy curve.

### 4.2 Music Theory Analogy

- **Minor modes** ↔ tension, unresolved feelings  
- **Major modes** ↔ resolution, triumph  
- **Rhythmic density** ↔ cut frequency / camera movement  
- **Syncopation** ↔ unexpected beats, jump cuts  

VDE does not implement full music theory, but it uses these analogies as
parameter hints (e.g., “more staccato” → shorter beats, higher energy spikes).

### 4.3 Geometry & Camera

- **Push-in** = increasing energy / narrowing focus  
- **Pull-back** = contextualizing energy / revealing world  
- **Static shot** = plateau or deliberate stillness  
- **Whip-pan** = sharp transient spike  

These map to changes in the derivative of the energy curve.

## 5. Implementation Overview

The reference implementation (`vde_engine.py`) includes:

- `VDEConfig` – timing & arc parameters  
- `Beat` – dataclass representing a single beat  
- `ScenePlan` – complete plan  
- `VibrationalDirectorEngine` – main generator  

Steps:

1. Normalize time.  
2. Build an energy envelope (three-act or other).  
3. Apply vibe modifiers (e.g., “slow-burn”, “frantic”).  
4. Assign:

   - emotional tones  
   - camera motions  
   - color tags  
   - music modes  

5. Return the `ScenePlan` as a list of beats.

## 6. PantheonOS Integration

VDE connects to:

- **Mythic Encoding**  
  - hero’s journey arcs as canonical patterns  
- **Gravity Well Effect**  
  - certain beats become “massive” anchor points  
- **Hogge Creativity Dice**  
  - used to introduce controlled variation in beat attributes  
- **Oracle Weave**  
  - can be used to reason about structural options for a scene  
- **Memetic Evolution Engine**  
  - evolve multiple scene variants and compare pacing profiles  

This positions VDE as the **cinematic / temporal wing** of PantheonOS.

---

## 7. Safety Considerations

- VDE is **not** a psychometric or manipulation tool.  
- It generates **timelines for fictional or creative work**.  
- It is transparent: every output is a visible beat list, not a black box.  
- It adheres to PantheonOS ethics (Arctic Framework ≥ 0.7).

---

## 8. Use Cases

- Planning a short film sequence  
- Designing the pacing of a trailer  
- Structuring a game cutscene  
- Finding the emotional curve of a key argument in a talk  
- Teaching narrative pacing and rhythm to students

---

## 9. Conclusion

The **Vibrational Director Engine** reframes directing as **vibration design**:

- energy as amplitude,  
- emotion as frequency & tone,  
- camera & color as harmonics,  
- scenes as waveforms.

This unlocks a more **conscious, tunable, and sharable** way to design experiences.
