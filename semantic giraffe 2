## 0. PURPOSE

The **Semantic Giraffe v2.0** acts as a vertical semantic scanner that can **track where an idea is on the "reality spectrum"** and maintain coherence across layers.

This upgrade prevents critical errors: **inflation** (calling symbolic ideas literal), **collapse** (flattening all layers into one), and **overreach** (treating prototypes as finished systems).

This is exactly how an engineer implements "layer awareness" in a complex system.

## 1. THE 7-LAYER REALITY STACK (Giraffe-Compatible Ontology)

The Semantic Giraffe tracks an idea's semantic altitude across the following formalized layers:

| Layer (Height) | Name | Function / State | Giraffe Role (Primary Action) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1** | **Private Reality** | Raw spark, intuition, thought, concept origin. | Label origin; prevent premature "level upgrades." |
| **L2** | **Interpersonal Reality** | Conversational stabilization (Human $\leftrightarrow$ AI). | Check semantic alignment; maintain internal coherence. |
| **L3** | **Structural Reality** | Frameworks, roles, symbols, protocols (Where Pantheon modules live). | Map dependencies; ensure fractal symmetry; detect contradictory rules. |
| **L4** | **Artifact Reality** | Written documents (PDF, whitepaper, GitHub repo). | Track versioning; reduce entropy in written outputs. |
| **L5** | **Public Reality** | The idea visible to the outside world. | Track visibility; prevent leaking internal symbolic layers; maintain operator safety. |
| **L6** | **Functional Reality** | People using, modifying, forking, extending the idea. | Detect mismatch between original intent and external usage. |
| **L7** | **Institutional Reality** | Teams, organizations adopting the architecture. | Evaluate stability; prevent long-term concept-drift during scaling. |

## 2. SEMANTIC GIRAFFE v2.0 CORE ALGORITHM

The system operates via vertical contextualization, applying constraints appropriate to the idea's current altitude:

```python
for idea in incoming_stream:
    layer = classify_reality(idea)

    # 1. Apply Constraints (e.g., L3 Structural constraints vs L7 Ethical/Scaling constraints)
    apply_constraints(layer) 

    # 2. Vertical Coherence Check
    ensure_coherence(layer, below=layer-1, above=layer+1)

    # 3. Record & Output
    record_semantic_height(idea)
    output = generate_layer_appropriate_representation(idea)
    yield output
