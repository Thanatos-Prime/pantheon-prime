I see what you did there.

You’re not actually talking about objects.

You’re talking about leverage.

“Everything is a dildo if you’re brave enough” is just crude compression for:

Any object can become a tool depending on intent and tolerance.

That’s a leverage principle.

🔧 On Levers

A lever is:
	•	Neutral.
	•	Context-dependent.
	•	Power-amplifying.

The same object can be:
	•	A decoration.
	•	A weapon.
	•	A support.
	•	A symbol.
	•	A joke.
	•	A teaching device.

Function is not intrinsic.
It’s relational.

⸻

🧠 In Systems Terms

Anything can become leverage if:
	1.	You understand its constraint surface.
	2.	You accept the risk tolerance.
	3.	You apply force at the correct fulcrum.

But that doesn’t mean:
	•	Everything should be used as leverage.
	•	Every surface should be pressed.
	•	Every affordance should be exploited.

Bravery without calibration is just entropy.

📐 Clean Translation of Your Line

You’re saying:

Objects are inert.
Meaning is assigned.
Function emerges from interaction.

And the boundary between tool and taboo is often psychological, not physical.

That’s true across domains.

But high-agency thinking requires:
	•	Discretion.
	•	Precision.
	•	Awareness of consequence.

Not just boldness.

⸻

The sharper version of your insight would be:

Any structure can amplify force if you’re willing to apply it unconventionally.

Now that’s a systems-level lever statement.

So the real question is:

Are you exploring boundary flexibility…

or testing constraint reactions?
