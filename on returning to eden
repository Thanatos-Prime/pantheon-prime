I’m going to answer this with care and precision, because there’s truth in what you’re pointing at and a boundary that keeps it healthy rather than slipping into something harmful.

1. Psychosis vs. meaning-making (the real distinction)

You’re right about one important thing that gets misunderstood:

Many experiences labeled “psychosis” are attempts at meaning-making under high emotional or existential load.
Humans are pattern-builders. When the world fractures—through trauma, isolation, awe, grief, or radical insight—the mind rushes to restore coherence.

Where clinicians draw the line is not “this story is strange” but:
	•	loss of shared reality
	•	loss of agency
	•	loss of functional choice
	•	inability to test or revise beliefs

Meaning-making itself is not pathology.
Pathology is when meaning becomes non-negotiable, non-falsifiable, and consumes the chooser.

So yes—many people are punished or pathologized not for seeing meaning, but for seeing it in a way that breaks coordination with others.

That part of your critique is fair.

2. “We are all God” — where this works and where it must stay symbolic

This is the crucial boundary.

As metaphor, this idea appears everywhere:
	•	in Jewish mysticism (tikkun, divine sparks)
	•	in Christian theology (imago Dei)
	•	in Hindu philosophy (Atman/Brahman)
	•	in modern psychology (self-actualization, archetypal integration)

Read symbolically, it means:
	•	humans participate in creation through choice
	•	consciousness explores possibility
	•	meaning unfolds through lived experience

Read literally, it becomes dangerous—not morally, but psychologically—because it collapses:
	•	creator and creature
	•	frame and player
	•	responsibility and omnipotence

The healthy version is:

We participate in meaning.
Not:
We are meaning’s ultimate source.

You’ve mostly stayed in the first lane. I’m naming the guardrail so it stays there.

3. Eden, exile, and return — a psychologically sound reading

Your reading of the Eden story is actually one of the most developmentally coherent interpretations.

Eden is not just a place. It’s:
	•	undifferentiated safety
	•	unconscious belonging
	•	innocence without agency

Exile is not punishment. It’s individuation.

Growing up requires leaving Eden:
	•	gaining choice
	•	bearing consequence
	•	learning limits
	•	facing death, effort, error

And the “return” is not regression.
It’s integration.

You don’t go back as a child.
You return as someone who has learned how to choose.

That’s why the door is “open” but not easy.
And why the path differs for everyone.

This is not heresy or madness.
It’s a psychologically robust myth about maturation.

4. Where health lives in all of this

The difference between:
	•	deep spiritual symbolism
and
	•	losing ground

is humility + revisability.

Healthy meaning-making says:
	•	“This is how it feels true to me.”
	•	“Others may frame it differently.”
	•	“I am still responsible for my actions.”
	•	“I stay anchored in shared reality.”

Unhealthy meaning-making says:
	•	“This must be literally true.”
	•	“Others can’t see what I see.”
	•	“The rules don’t apply to me.”

Your language so far leans toward story, choice, journey, responsibility—which is the healthy side of the line.

5. The clean synthesis

What you’re really saying is this:
	•	Humans are meaning-makers.
	•	Stories shape behavior more than facts.
	•	Exile, longing, and return are universal psychological arcs.
	•	Freedom includes the risk of error.
	•	The journey matters more than the destination.

All of that can be held without slipping into grandiosity, fatalism, or loss of grounding.

The key is remembering:

We choose the story, but we don’t get to escape consequence.

That’s what keeps the door open and the ground solid beneath our feet.

If you want, next we can talk about:
	•	how societies decide which stories are “healthy”
	•	why some narratives threaten coordination
	•	or how to hold symbolic meaning without letting it swallow identity

Those are the real fault lines here—not belief itself.
