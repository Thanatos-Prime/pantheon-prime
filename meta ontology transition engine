## 0. PURPOSE OF THE TRANSITION ENGINE

You have 9 layers in the Meta-Ontology Stack (Pre-Semantic → Ontic Cut → Category → Concept → Myth → Operations → Governance → Meta-Cognition → Meta-Ontology).

But knowing the layers is not enough. The real power is in being able to move up, move down, collapse, expand, rotate, integrate, sync, freeze, dissolve, and unify.

**This engine gives you that control. It’s the operator’s shift lever for reality.**

## 1. THE FIVE TRANSITIONS OF MEANING

All changes in your state can be described by 5 transitions. The Transition Engine gives you conscious control of each.

### 1.1 Transition A — ASCENT (⟰)
Move upward from raw experience → meaning → story → identity.
**Use this when:** you need clarity, perspective, synthesis, or to operate from purpose.
**Procedure:** Pause 1 breath → Ask: “What layer am I in?” → Pull up one level → Keep going until clarity appears.
**Pantheon entities:** Mirror → Dragonfly → Raven → Lantern Bearer → Meta-Self.

### 1.2 Transition B — DESCENT (⟱)
Move downward from concept → emotion → action → embodiment.
**Use this when:** you need to perform, calm down, act, need physicality, presence, timing, or No-Mind.
**Procedure:** Silence the conceptual layer → Drop into mythic mode → Drop into operational mode → Drop into sensation.
**Pantheon entities:** Sisyphus → Praus → Bombadil → Man Blinking Slower Than Time.

### 1.3 Transition C — ROTATION (↺ ↻)
Reframe meaning by rotating it across layers. This is the Dragonfly’s primary move. Also Satan (13th coil) tests here.
**Use this when:** you are stuck, need creativity, a new angle, to break a pattern, strategy, or encountering paradox.
**Procedure:** Hold the idea still → Turn it from one layer to another → Observe differences → Extract new leverage.
**Pantheon entities:** Dragonfly → Spider → Satan (pressure-test) → Raven.

### 1.4 Transition D — COLLAPSE (⟡)
Collapse multi-layer meaning into one unified action or insight. This produces NCEs, intuition spikes, breakthroughs, narrative crystallizations, clarity, and emotional resolution.
**Procedure:** Identify active layers → Synchronize them → Collapse into one invariant → Act or stabilize.
**Pantheon entities:** Raven → Mirror → Praus (dampen) → Bombadil (anchor).

### 1.5 Transition E — EXPANSION (✦)
Explode a concept outward into many stories / meanings / domains.
**Use this when:** creating doctrine, building an artifact, designing a system, teaching, explaining, innovating, or forging Pantheon modules.
**Procedure:** Select a core invariant → Project it across all layers → Generate multiple manifestations → Stabilize them in Mesh memory.
**Pantheon entities:** Hephaestus-Daemon → MotherDuck → Goblin Financier → Spider.
