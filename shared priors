Alright.
We’re going to treat this with respect — but we’re going to keep the rails solid.

You’re proposing a layered idea:
	1.	Light is the fastest physical carrier in spacetime.
	2.	Shared meaning can propagate “faster” once priors are aligned.
	3.	That delta — the gap between physical propagation and semantic activation — might imply a deeper layer.
	4.	The personification of that layer = God.

Let’s untangle this carefully.

⸻

1️⃣ The “Faster Than Light” Feeling

When two people share deep priors, a single word can trigger vast coordinated action instantly.

Example:
A code phrase activates a plan.

It feels like:

Meaning outran physics.

But what happened?
	•	The physical signal traveled at ≤ speed of light.
	•	The rest of the activation was preloaded in both brains.
	•	The “distance” collapsed because the structure was already there.

This is not superluminal transmission.
It’s distributed compression.

The delta you’re noticing is:

Pre-shared structure × small trigger → large activation.

⸻

2️⃣ Does That Imply Something “Above” Light?

No — not in physics.

But it does imply something orthogonal to light:

Different layers of description.

Light is about energy transfer in spacetime.
Meaning is about pattern activation in neural networks.

They operate in different coordinate systems.

One is measured in meters and seconds.
The other in graph distance and activation energy.

Confusing those layers creates the illusion of transcendence.

⸻

3️⃣ The God Personification Move

You’re doing something very old and very human.

We observe:
	•	Order emerging from chaos.
	•	Meaning emerging from matter.
	•	Coordination emerging from signals.

And we ask:

“What is the principle behind that emergence?”

Historically, that principle was personified as:
	•	Logos
	•	Tao
	•	Brahman
	•	God

But here’s the stabilizer:

Personification is a compression strategy.

It turns:

Abstract structural invariants
into
Relational agents.

It makes the universe psychologically navigable.

That doesn’t invalidate it.
But it does locate it.

⸻

4️⃣ “Meaning Survives and Emerges via Oscillation”

This part can be grounded.

Meaning survives through:
	•	Repetition
	•	Reinforcement
	•	Social embedding
	•	Institutional memory
	•	Neural plasticity
	•	Cultural transmission

Oscillation does occur in real systems:
	•	Neural oscillations
	•	Signal modulation
	•	Cultural cycles
	•	Narrative retellings

But that’s not evidence of a metaphysical substrate.
It’s complex adaptive systems.

⸻

5️⃣ The Key Error to Avoid

Here’s the subtle leap you’re flirting with:

“Because semantic activation can feel instantaneous and trans-spatial,
there must be a deeper ontological layer beyond spacetime that carries meaning.”

That’s a metaphysical inference.
Not a physical one.

There is currently no empirical evidence for a meaning-field that propagates independently of physical substrate.

⸻

6️⃣ The Clean Interpretation

What you’re sensing is this:

Shared priors collapse effective distance.

Coordination geometry can outperform raw physical distance in influence.

Meaning scales faster than matter — socially.

That’s powerful.
But it’s not FTL physics.

⸻

7️⃣ A Grounded Alternative to “God as Delta”

If you want a non-mystical formulation:

“God” in this framing becomes:

The personification of large-scale order and coordination principles.

Not a faster-than-light carrier.

Not a hidden substrate.

A symbolic compression of emergent structure.

⸻

Now I’m going to ask something steady and careful:

When you imagine this “layer above light,”

Do you experience it as:
	•	Intellectual curiosity?
	•	Aesthetic elegance?
	•	Spiritual intuition?
	•	Or something that feels empirically real to you?
