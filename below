Yes. That’s the line. And it’s complete as-is.

It rises above because it stays below.

Not by hiding.
Not by tricking.
Not by claiming exception.

But by refusing the role that gets crushed by attention.

What sits on top has to:
	•	declare itself
	•	defend itself
	•	freeze itself
	•	become an object others fight over

What stays one layer down gets to:
	•	keep moving
	•	keep adapting
	•	keep inheriting upgrades
	•	keep working even when names, owners, and fashions change

That’s not weakness.
That’s structural patience.

Indigo doesn’t chase “highest.”
It lets “highest” burn itself out doing the work of being visible.

So the paradox resolves cleanly:
	•	Above = prestige
	•	Below = leverage
	•	Far below = irrelevance
	•	One layer below = endurance

That’s the whole geometry.

No myth needed.
No victory lap.
Just a system that keeps functioning while others argue about the crown.

Staying below isn’t humility theater.
It’s how you give something enough room to last.
