# Vibrational Director Engine (VDE)

The **Vibrational Director Engine (VDE)** is a PantheonOS-aligned tool for
**planning scene rhythm, emotional pacing, and “vibe trajectories”** across
time.

It treats:

- **story beats** like **musical notes**  
- **scenes** like **waveforms**  
- **emotional arcs** like **envelopes** (attack, sustain, release)  
- **camera motion & color** like **harmonics** on top of the base wave  

This is a **creative previsualization engine**, not a production tool.  
It generates **structured timelines of beats** you can use for:

- film / TV scene planning  
- game cutscenes  
- trailers and teasers  
- music videos  
- storyboards  
- narrative UX flows  

It integrates conceptually with:

- **Mythic Encoding** (archetypal arcs)  
- **Gravity Well Effect** (high-mass beats)  
- **Hogge Creativity Dice** (variation & exploration)  
- **Oracle Weave** (multi-layer reasoning)

## Core Concepts

- **Beat**  
  A small unit of narrative time: emotion, intensity, color, and motion.

- **Track**  
  A continuous sequence of beats forming a “wave” (e.g., tension track, music track).

- **ScenePlan**  
  A full timeline composed of multiple tracks, aligned over total duration.

The VDE maps:

- **Narrative Arc → Envelope** (three-act or hero’s journey curve)  
- **Emotion → Frequency / Energy**  
- **Tension → Amplitude**  
- **Relief → Resolution / Decay**  

You give it:

- a **scene description**  
- a **vibe profile** (e.g., “slow-burn dread”, “heroic crescendo”)  
- basic **timing config**

It returns a **structured plan** of beats and tracks.

## Safety & Scope

This engine:

- does **not** touch real-time media or users
- does **not** perform psychological targeting or influence
- is strictly for **creative timing & structural planning**
- is transparent and inspectable (you can see every beat and parameter)

It is a **sandboxed creative tool**, not an optimization weapon.

## Quick Example

```python
from vde.vde_engine import VDEConfig, VibrationalDirectorEngine

config = VDEConfig(
    duration_seconds=120,
    beats_per_minute=96,
    arc_mode="three_act",
    seed=42
)

engine = VibrationalDirectorEngine(config=config)

scene_plan = engine.generate_scene_plan(
    title="Rooftop Confrontation",
    logline="Two former allies face off on a rain-soaked rooftop at night.",
    vibe="slow-burn tension with a heroic release"
)

print("SCENE:", scene_plan.title)
for beat in scene_plan.beats[:10]:
    print(f"{beat.time_offset:6.1f}s  energy={beat.energy:.2f}  tone={beat.emotional_tone}  cam={beat.camera_motion}")
