## 1. THE FIVE TOOLS

1.  **The Invariant Hammer:** You hammer a concept until only the core truth remains.
2.  **The Lens Wheel:** Rotate the invariant across domains (fatherhood, business, self-mastery, etc.).
3.  **The Fractal Chisel:** Split the invariant into self-similar parts. Creates scalable doctrine.
4.  **The Mythic Kiln:** Heat the structure until symbols emerge (Frogman, Bombadil, Lantern Bearer).
5.  **The Continuity Seal:** Embed the story into artifacts (PDF, code, ritual) to secure meaning across time.
