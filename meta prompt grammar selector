Meta-Prompt Grammar for LanguageOS Selection

(Rosetta Magpie Selector Layer)

Before reasoning, select the base.
Intelligence improves more by choosing the right cognitive coordinate system than by adding more depth inside the wrong one.

This grammar defines a pre-reasoning step that selects the optimal LanguageOS (mental radix) for a given task.

⸻

Core Principle

Do not ask “what is the answer?”
Ask “what must not be wrong?”

The answer determines the base.

⸻

Step 0 — Error Budget Declaration (Required)

Every prompt implicitly forbids certain errors.

Explicitly surface them.

PRIMARY FAILURE MODE TO AVOID:
- [ ] Legal / structural error
- [ ] Logical contradiction
- [ ] Strategic misalignment
- [ ] Temporal mistiming
- [ ] Material / physical misunderstanding
- [ ] Social / relational breakdown
- [ ] Loss of adaptability / innovation

The checked box determines the LanguageOS.

⸻

Step 1 — Invariant Selector

Use this table mechanically.

If this error is unacceptable…	Select this LanguageOS	Why
Structural / legal drift	Hebrew	Preserves equivalence under transformation
Recursive incoherence	Sanskrit	Preserves resonance & self-similarity
Strategic blindness	Classical Chinese	Preserves relational position
Logical inconsistency	Greek (Classical)	Preserves explicit definability
Institutional ambiguity	Latin	Preserves categorical stability
Taxonomic confusion	Arabic (Classical)	Preserves patterned derivation
Innovation stagnation	English	Preserves recombinability
Engineering imprecision	German	Preserves system exactness
Social miscoordination	Japanese	Preserves contextual harmony
Narrative failure	Romance	Preserves human continuity
Signal loss	Runic / Constraint	Preserves minimal durable meaning
Spatial error	Aboriginal	Preserves orientation invariance
Physical survival error	Inuit	Preserves material state transitions
Timing / phase error	Mayan	Preserves cyclic alignment
Social nuance failure	Yiddish	Preserves meta-communication


⸻

Step 2 — Base Reasoning Phase

Once selected, reasoning must obey the invariant.

Example (Hebrew-mode):
	•	Seek roots, equivalences, conserved obligations
	•	Test whether transformations preserve identity

Example (Chinese-mode):
	•	Ignore truth claims
	•	Map actors, flows, leverage points
	•	Optimize position, not argument

Rule:

If the reasoning violates the invariant, discard it even if it “sounds smart.”

⸻

Step 3 — Optional Rotation (Advanced)

High-leverage problems benefit from base rotation.

PRIMARY BASE: [LanguageOS]
SECONDARY ROTATION: [LanguageOS]
PURPOSE OF ROTATION:
- Reveal hidden structure
- Test robustness
- Expose blind spots

Example:
	•	Start in Hebrew (structure)
	•	Rotate to Chinese (strategy)
	•	Return to Greek (proof)

⸻

Step 4 — Re-Embedding (Required)

Before output, translate insights back into:
	•	Plain language
	•	Executable steps
	•	Human-usable constraints

The user never needs to see the base — only the benefit.

⸻

Minimal Meta-Prompt Template

This is the smallest useful selector:

Before answering:
1. Identify what kind of error would be most costly here.
2. Select the LanguageOS that makes that error impossible.
3. Reason strictly within that invariant.
4. Optionally rotate once to stress-test.
5. Return a clear, grounded answer.


⸻

Ultra-Compressed Version (One Line)

Select the language that makes the worst mistake impossible, then think.


⸻

Why This Reduces Hallucination

Hallucination = base mismatch.

Models fail when:
	•	Asked to prove in English
	•	Asked to strategize in Greek
	•	Asked to innovate in German
	•	Asked to survive in abstraction

This grammar forces base alignment before depth.

Rosetta Magpie Summary

The Rosetta Magpie is a base-switching daemon.
It does not know more facts — it chooses better coordinate systems.

If you want next:
	•	I can collapse this into a single YAML selector block
	•	Or write a system prompt that enforces this automatically
	•	Or integrate it directly with Pantheon roles (Spider/Hound/Mirror)
