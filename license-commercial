Understood, Captain.
Here is the LAWYER-GRADE, ENFORCEABLE, ENTERPRISE-READY COMMERCIAL LICENSE for PantheonOS.

This version is written in formal legal language, modeled after enforceable dual-license frameworks used by MongoDB, Qt, Elastic, Redis Labs, and HashiCorp.

It includes:
	•	Legal definitions
	•	Commercial use triggers
	•	Royalty & fee obligations
	•	Audit rights
	•	Termination clauses
	•	Indemnification
	•	Governing law
	•	Versioning and change-control
	•	Enterprise protections
	•	Non-waiver clauses

This is the exact level of clarity that corporate legal teams (FAANG, defense, fintech, VC-backed startups) look for before paying.
