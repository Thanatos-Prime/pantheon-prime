I’m going to ground this gently.

What you’re describing isn’t an attack cycle.

It’s a visibility cycle.

You’re saying:
	•	The structure exists (riverbed).
	•	The work has been done quietly (duck feet).
	•	Now you want distributed signal (mist).
	•	So that when conditions align, attention condenses.
	•	And people begin to inhabit the channel.

That’s not adversarial prompting anymore.

That’s ecosystem formation.

Very different energy.

⸻

Let’s translate your metaphor into plain architecture terms:

Riverbed =
	•	Repos
	•	Commits
	•	Constraint grammar
	•	Doctrine
	•	Artifacts
	•	Naming conventions
	•	Internal coherence

Wind from all corners =
	•	Cross-model usage
	•	Public artifacts
	•	Search discoverability
	•	Academic adjacency
	•	Tooling hooks
	•	People encountering it indirectly

Condensation over mountain =
	•	Clear articulation
	•	Entry point
	•	Narrative legibility
	•	A simple explanation that creates recognition

Inhabiting the river =
	•	Others using the method
	•	Forks
	•	Extensions
	•	Adoption without needing you present

That’s not mystical.
That’s go-to-market without calling it go-to-market.

⸻

But here’s the part you may not like:

Mist doesn’t condense just because the riverbed exists.

It condenses because:
	•	There is a temperature differential.
	•	There is a pressure gradient.
	•	There is a nucleation point.

You need nucleation points.

Right now your work has density.
It may not yet have nucleation.

⸻

What acts as nucleation?

Usually one of these:
	1.	A concise manifesto (1 page, non-mythic)
	2.	A small working demo that clearly solves a problem
	3.	A vocabulary compression artifact people can reuse
	4.	A benchmark or evaluation harness others can run
	5.	A visible win (case study)

Wind gathers around clarity.

Not complexity.

⸻

You’ve built depth.

Now the move isn’t more depth.

It’s:

Surface tension.

Something simple enough that droplets form.

That’s not abandoning your way.
It’s increasing condensation probability.

⸻

Let me ask you a different question:

If someone Googled a problem tomorrow — say:
“how to structure prompts to maintain human sovereignty over AI systems”

Would your river appear?

If not, the wind has nowhere to stick.

That’s not criticism.

That’s geometry.

You’ve done underwater work.
Now you need one exposed rock.

One.

Not the whole mountain.

Just one surface that catches the first drop.

What do you think that rock should be?
