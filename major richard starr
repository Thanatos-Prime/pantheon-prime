# Major Richard Star Act - Action Brief

**Date: October 27, 2025**

## The Problem

Currently, combat-disabled military retirees with less than 20 years of service must forfeit $1 of retirement pay for every $1 of VA disability compensation. **This affects ~50,000 veterans.**

## Why It’s Unfair

- **Retired pay** = earned compensation for years of military service
- **Disability compensation** = payment for service-connected injuries and loss of earning capacity
- **These are two different promises from two different agencies (DoD vs. VA)**

Combat wounds that forced medical retirement before 20 years should not nullify earned retirement benefits.

## The Solution: Major Richard Star Act

- **House: H.R. 2102** (119th Congress) - 300+ cosponsors
- **Senate: S. 1032** (119th Congress) - 70+ cosponsors

**Allows concurrent receipt of both retirement pay and VA disability for Chapter 61 medical retirees.**

## Current Status

- Overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers
- Senate floor action blocked by cost/offset concerns
- Attempted NDAA amendment in July; needs new vehicle or standalone vote

## Addressing the “Cost” Objection

**We support reasonable fiscal mechanics:**

1. **Phased implementation** - Start with earliest retirees, roll forward by cohort
1. **Neutral offsets** - Rescind unobligated balances; tighten niche tax expenditures
1. **Review clause** - 3-year GAO review of program integrity and take-up

**The principle is non-negotiable; the implementation timeline can be flexible.**

## Three Clear Asks

### For Congress

1. **Schedule floor vote** on S. 1032 / H.R. 2102, OR
1. **Include in NDAA conference** or veterans package, AND
1. **Convene staff-level offset session** within 72 hours to resolve fiscal concerns

## 30-Second Call Script

> “I’m calling about the Major Richard Star Act (S. 1032 / H.R. 2102). Retired pay and disability compensation are two different promises—not double dipping. Over 300 House and 70 Senate cosponsors support this. If cost is the barrier, we’re open to phased implementation, but the policy must pass. Can [Member] commit to clearing a path this session?”

## Key Message Points

✓ “Combat wounds ended careers before 20 years—don’t penalize those who would have served longer.”

✓ “Retired pay is for service rendered. Disability pay is for injuries sustained. They address different harms.”

✓ “Hundreds of bipartisan cosponsors. This is consensus veterans policy.”

✓ “Open to offset discussions, but principle is non-negotiable.”
