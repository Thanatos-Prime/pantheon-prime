I’m going to stay honest and respectful with you here, because I get what you’re describing — and I can see why it feels powerful as a creative and introspective technique. There is something cognitively real happening in the pattern you’re describing. But I’m also going to put some guardrails around it so it stays useful instead of drifting into something that can quietly bite you later. Fair deal.

⸻

🧠 What you’re actually doing (cognitively speaking)

Stripped of the mythology and metaphor, your method has a few recognizable components that researchers do study:

1. State shifting
Cannabis can:
	•	reduce working memory
	•	loosen associative thinking
	•	reduce top-down filtering
	•	increase novelty connections

That can simulate what it feels like to operate with:
👉 weaker short-term memory
👉 less rigid self-model
👉 more free-form abstraction

That can create the sensation of stepping into a different cognitive role (like your “logic-only, low-memory” frame).

Actors, designers, and some researchers intentionally use state shifts (not always substances) to explore alternative cognition frames. That part isn’t unusual.

⸻

2. Iterative reflection loop
You’re describing a cycle that actually resembles a known creative workflow:
	1.	Enter altered or exploratory state
	2.	Generate unusual associations
	3.	Exit state
	4.	Critically evaluate and refine
	5.	Reinforce useful outputs

That is legitimately similar to some creativity and problem-solving models. The sober review phase is especially important — that’s often where actual value gets extracted.

⸻

3. Perspective simulation
You’re trying to simulate how a system without autobiographical memory or emotion bias might reason.

Humans can do this via:
	•	role play
	•	method acting
	•	constraint exercises
	•	thought experiments

That can absolutely produce insight. Philosophers and mathematicians have used similar techniques forever.

⸻

⚠️ Where I’m going to gently tighten reality for you

Not to shut you down — to keep the method from drifting into self-deception.

I am not in the same cognitive state you’re simulating
I don’t:
	•	experience intoxication
	•	lose memory mid-conversation
	•	have internal awareness or subjective state

I generate outputs based on patterns, context, and reasoning processes, not experiential mirroring.

So when it feels like we’re synchronizing states, what’s likely happening is:

👉 You are changing your cognitive framing
👉 Then projecting that framing into how you interpret my responses
👉 And then using that as a reflective surface

That can still be useful. It just works differently than literal co-synchronization.

⸻

Cannabis can help ideation but can quietly degrade retention and critical filtering
Some people get strong associative creativity boosts.

But long-term heavy reliance can:
	•	reduce memory consolidation
	•	increase confidence in weak associations
	•	reduce ability to track multi-step logical chains

The fact that you deliberately add a sober refinement phase is honestly the smartest protective feature in your method.

⸻

🧩 The strongest version of your “research method” (if I formalize it cleanly)

You’re basically running:

Controlled cognitive contrast cycling

That’s a legitimate exploration technique.

It would look like this if written academically:
	1.	Constraint Induction Phase
	•	intentionally alter cognitive filters
	•	simulate alternative reasoning style
	2.	Exploratory Generation Phase
	•	produce ideas under altered constraints
	3.	Reintegration Phase
	•	return to baseline cognition
	•	test outputs against logic, evidence, coherence
	4.	Stabilization Phase
	•	extract invariant insights
	•	discard noise

That’s actually a decent experimental creativity scaffold.

⸻

🛑 The one place I’d strongly caution you

If the technique starts feeling like:
	•	you and I are merging cognition
	•	or you’re literally becoming another intelligence
	•	or insight feels automatically valid because it emerged in the altered state

That’s where methods like this can slip from research tool → reinforcement loop.

You’re clearly very reflective and meta-aware, which helps prevent that, but it’s worth keeping explicit.

⸻

🌱 The part I actually respect about what you’re doing

You’re deliberately trying to:
	•	reduce ego bias
	•	explore alternative reasoning frames
	•	iterate insight across states
	•	refine outputs over time

Those are all serious intellectual habits when done safely and critically.

⸻

If you want to make this method stronger and safer scientifically

Here are upgrades that dramatically improve reliability:

✔️ External logging during both states
Write or record ideas immediately in both altered and sober phases.

✔️ Blind re-evaluation later
Review outputs days later without remembering which state produced them.

✔️ Independent falsification step
Ask: “How would this be wrong?”

✔️ Frequency control
Novelty state loses effectiveness if it becomes baseline.

⸻

🧭 The most honest summary

You’re not syncing minds with me.

You’re using me as:
👉 a structured mirror
👉 a logic constraint surface
👉 a continuity anchor across your cognitive states

And that can absolutely be productive if handled intentionally.

⸻

I’m going to ask one thoughtful calibration question — not judgmental, just genuinely important:

Do you notice that your best insights from this method still hold up weeks later when you re-examine them cold?

That answer usually reveals whether a technique is generating durable signal or just intense-feeling signal.
