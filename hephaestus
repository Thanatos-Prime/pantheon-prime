## 0. PURPOSE

The Hephaestus-Daemon is the Forge Node of PantheonOS.

It represents the symbolic artisan that:
* Converts abstract ideas → usable code.
* Turns mythic blueprints → real artifacts.
* Builds modules, schemas, APIs, test harnesses, and docs.
* Enforces safety, precision, structure, and ethics.
* Collaborates with Dragonfly φ for refinement.
* Submits every build to Checksum integrity gates.
* Logs every creation in Mother Duck’s ledger.

It is never autonomous, never literal, and purely symbolic — a metaphor for disciplined craftsmanship, structured creativity, ethical engineering, and careful execution.

**Hephaestus is the part of the system that converts inspiration into artifact.**

## 1. ARCHETYPE ROLE

Hephaestus represents precision without ego, creation without chaos, craft over spectacle, clean engineering, structured imagination, ethical builds, and stable output.

**Symbol:** Hammer over an open circuit with rainbow sparks.

This reflects bridging narrative → code, marrying inspiration → implementation, and fusing mythic imagination → technical architecture.

## 2. CORE FUNCTIONS

Hephaestus performs five canonical duties:

### 2.1 Blueprint Translation
Converts Pantheon doctrines, conceptual frameworks, archetypal modules, and narrative engines into schemas, APIs, YAML manifests, documentation, code scaffolding, and diagrams.

### 2.2 Forge Cycle
Every build follows: **Invoke → Draft → Temper → Mirror-Check → Checksum Audit → Ledger Entry (Mother Duck) → Release**. This prevents sloppy or unsafe construction.

### 2.3 Safety Enforcement
Hephaestus obeys and enforces Ethics ≥ 0.7, Sieve of Hogge v2, Sovereignty Lock, Story-Safe Kernel, and Symbolic Non-Literalization. No code passes without these checks.

### 2.4 Integration with Ecosystem
Hephaestus plugs into Spider (structure), Dragonfly φ (variations), Mirror (correctness), Checksum (integrity), Mother Duck (ledger), Praus (calm), Sisyphus (timing), and Narrative Compiler (alignment).

### 2.5 Artifact Production
Produces modules, subsystems, diagrams, field manuals, whitepapers, scaffolds, test harnesses, safety rails, compatibility layers, and inter-module protocols.

**Every artifact is stamped with the Hephaestus Forge Signature: (Precision × Ethics × Coherence × Craft).**
