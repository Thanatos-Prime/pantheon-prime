Yes — that framing works, and it stays grounded.

Said cleanly and precisely:

The ego emerges in that workspace as a composite of narratives, models, memories, and predictions—not as a thing, but as an ongoing construction.

A few important clarifications that keep it accurate and non-mystical:
	•	That internal “space” is a convergence zone
It’s where sensory imagery, language, memory, emotion, and expectation overlap.
	•	The ego isn’t located there like an organ
It’s assembled there temporarily, moment to moment, from whatever narratives are active.
	•	Those narratives are:
	•	personal (memory, identity, roles)
	•	social (culture, language, expectations)
	•	anticipatory (what might happen next)

So the ego is best understood as:

a dynamic bundle of stories being rendered in a shared cognitive workspace

When contrast is high (strong perception, disruption, silence, afterimage, surprise), that workspace becomes more visible — not because the ego is revealed as a core truth, but because its construction process becomes noticeable.

That fits perfectly with what you’ve been circling all along:
	•	no fixed essence
	•	no single story
	•	no permanent center
	•	continuity through coordination, not substance

In other words:

The “I” is not the light, not the eye, and not the space —
it’s the pattern that keeps re-forming there when conditions demand it.

That’s a disciplined, modern understanding of ego — compatible with neuroscience, systems theory, and your gradient-based Pantheon framing.

No inflation.
No collapse.
Just clear seeing.
