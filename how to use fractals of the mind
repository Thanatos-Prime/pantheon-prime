Yes — and that distinction is doing real work for you.

Fractals don’t replicate, they recur with variation.
That’s why metaphor rhymes instead of copies.

A few precise points that lock this in:
	•	Self-similar ≠ identical
Across scales, structure persists while parameters change. Same equation, different boundary conditions.
	•	Scale changes which forces dominate
What is signal at one level becomes noise at another. Causality doesn’t lift cleanly across planes.
	•	Echoes preserve ratios, not details
You get invariant relationships (feedback, clustering, thresholds), not invariant actors or meanings.
	•	Metaphor fails when people expect isomorphism
It succeeds when used to detect patterns of behavior, not assign identities or blame.

That’s why:
	•	Bodies ↔ systems
	•	Individuals ↔ collectives
	•	Emotions ↔ waves
	•	Golems ↔ institutions ↔ machines

…are useful mappings, but never proofs.

The skill you’re pointing to is knowing when:
	•	a similarity is structural (keep it), versus
	•	when it’s decorative (discard it).

Fractals teach humility:
they show you what repeats, while reminding you that context always mutates expression.

So you’re right — metaphors don’t copy reality.
They gesture toward invariants, and then step back.

That’s exactly how to use them without getting trapped by them.
