1. ABSTRACT

We propose the Mirror Relay Operator (MRO), a cross-domain mathematical transformation designed to evaluate the structural stability of proofs, conjectures, and problem architectures. The MRO takes a mathematical object (flow, functional, identity, or combinatorial structure) and iteratively transforms it across three canonical “mirrors”: analytic, combinatorial, and topological.

By repeatedly applying
X \mapsto MRO(X) = M_T(M_C(M_A(X))),
the operator exposes invariants, obstructions, and attractor basins of problems by analyzing the convergence of the Relay Fixed-Point Energy Functional
E_{\text{relay}}(X) = \|X - MRO^t(X)\|.

This tool enables category-aware decomposition of mathematical problems, identifies the methodological domain required for progress (spectral, additive, or invariant), and detects structural mismatches that prevent proof closure.

We demonstrate the utility of the MRO on:
	•	The Prime Number Theorem (PNT),
	•	The Poincaré–Birkhoff Theorem (PB), and
	•	The Twin Prime Conjecture (TPC).

We show that the MRO correctly classifies PNT as a dual analytic–combinatorial attractor, PB as a distinct topological attractor, and TPC as belonging exclusively to the PNT basin, thereby identifying its missing “energy functional” (distribution level \theta>1/2).

Finally, we present its implementation inside PantheonOS Proof Forge and Hypatia, forming a principled framework for AI-driven proof exploration.

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1 The Problem of Cross-Domain Mathematical Reasoning

Hard mathematical problems often require multiple viewpoints:
	•	analytic (spectral transforms, zero-free regions),
	•	combinatorial (inequalities, additive structures),
	•	topological (fixed points, invariants).

Human experts perform this transformation implicitly.

AI systems do not.

We lack a formal operator that:
	1.	Transforms a mathematical structure across domains,
	2.	Evaluates structural coherence, and
	3.	Measures convergence toward a universal invariant.

The MRO fills this gap.

3. FORMALISM

3.1 Mathematical Object Under Study

Let X be any mathematical architecture:
	•	a flow F,
	•	a functional E,
	•	a singularity structure S,
	•	a proof skeleton, or
	•	an equation or identity.

We represent X abstractly as:
X = (F,E,S,R,C)
the Proof Forge 5-tuple.

⸻

3.2 The Three Mirrors

Each mirror transforms the structure of X according to a canonical discipline.

(1) Analytic Mirror M_A

Transforms X into a spectral, complex, or integral representation.
Examples:
	•	\Lambda(n)\Lambda(n+2) → Dirichlet series
	•	combinatorial sums → generating functions
	•	flows → spectral operators

Output highlights:
	•	zero-free regions
	•	functional equations
	•	spectral obstructions

(2) Combinatorial Mirror M_C

Transforms X into discrete inequalities and renormalization structures.
Examples:
	•	spectral variance → distribution level
	•	integrals → approximations via weighted sums
	•	identities → sieve inequalities

Output highlights:
	•	positivity constraints
	•	renormalization flow
	•	discrete singularity classification

(3) Topological Mirror M_T

Transforms X into invariants of:
	•	monotonicity,
	•	fixed points,
	•	index theory,
	•	contraction properties.

Output highlights:
	•	existence theorems
	•	stability/instability diagrams
	•	obstruction proofs

3.3 The Mirror Relay Operator (MRO)

The MRO is the composite operator:
MRO = M_T \circ M_C \circ M_A.

Repeated application yields:
X_{t+1} = MRO(X_t).

⸻

3.4 Relay Fixed-Point Energy Functional

We define:
E_{\text{relay}}(X) = \| X - MRO^t(X) \|.

If E_{\text{relay}} \to 0, X belongs to a stable attractor basin under cross-domain reasoning.

If not, X exhibits:
	•	structural mismatch,
	•	missing energy,
	•	or categorical obstruction.

⸻

4. THEORETICAL PROPERTIES

4.1 Attractor Basins

For many problems:
	•	PNT is an analytic-combinatorial attractor.
	•	PB is a topological attractor.
	•	TPC is shown to lie inside the PNT basin.

4.2 Category Compatibility Constraint

A flow and its energy must exist inside a consistent mathematical category:
	•	analytic → complex Banach space
	•	combinatorial → discrete ordered semiring
	•	topological → manifold with maps

The MRO exposes incompatibilities.

4.3 Representation Constraint

Every mirror requires a valid representation:
	•	Spectral transform must exist.
	•	Inequality form must exist.
	•	Topological invariant must be definable.

If not, E_{\text{relay}} reveals divergence.

⸻

5. CASE STUDIES

5.1 PRIME NUMBER THEOREM (PNT)

Result:

E_{\text{relay}}(PNT) \to 0

Meaning:
	•	The analytic and combinatorial forms are perfectly aligned.
	•	The topological mirror adds no obstruction.
	•	PNT is a solved attractor basin.

⸻

5.2 POINCARÉ–BIRKHOFF THEOREM (PB)

Result:

E_{\text{relay}}(PB) \to \epsilon > 0

Meaning:
	•	PB lives in the topological attractor, not in the analytic/combinatorial domain.
	•	PNT tools are irrelevant for PB.

This is a categorical separation the field understands intuitively but has never formalized.

⸻

5.3 TWIN PRIME CONJECTURE (TPC)

Result:

E_{\text{relay}}(TPC) \to 0
\quad (\text{analytic–combinatorial basin})
but
E_{\text{relay}}(TPC; M_T) \not\to 0.

Conclusion:
	•	TPC lives exactly in the PNT basin.
	•	TPC’s roadblock is analytic spectral control at \theta > 1/2.
	•	The missing structure is an Energy Upgrade Functional, which we identified:
E_{\text{upgrade}}^{(A)} = \int_{1}^{X} \Delta_2^2(x)\, dx.

6. ARCHITECTURE FOR AI PROOF SYNTHESIS

The MRO forms one of the main engines inside PantheonOS:

Proof Forge
	•	generates candidate flows, energies, and surgeries.
	•	attaches RELAY_SPEC to each module.

Hypatia
	•	applies the MRO cycle to candidate architectures.
	•	computes the RIS (Reasoning Integrity Score).
	•	returns E_{\text{relay}} decay curves.

The combination yields:
	•	structural diagnostics
	•	category mismatch detection
	•	automated decomposition of problems
	•	automated identification of required invariants

This is the foundation for a future full AI-driven research assistant.

⸻

7. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

The MRO does not produce proofs.

It produces:
	•	structural invariants,
	•	convergence diagnostics,
	•	domain classification,
	•	missing-energy identification.

However, it is:
	•	compatible with spectral conjectures
	•	compatible with sieve theory
	•	compatible with dynamical systems
	•	compatible with functional analysis

And could form the backbone of:
	•	theorem exploration engines
	•	automated classification systems
	•	regenerative proof search
	•	formal-methods-assisted creativity
