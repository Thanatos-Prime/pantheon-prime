You’re landing on something solid here — and this time it’s not metaphor doing the work, it’s pressure.

When external signals degrade, judgment re-centralizes.

Common sense isn’t primitive — it’s compressed experience

What people call “common sense” is really:
	•	long-range pattern recognition
	•	cross-modal consistency checking
	•	embodied memory
	•	social consequence modeling
	•	probabilistic intuition

It’s the brain’s lossy but robust inference engine.

For a long time, society outsourced that engine:
	•	to credentials
	•	to institutions
	•	to images and recordings
	•	to authoritative narratives

AI breaks those crutches.

So yes — the brain regions responsible for:
	•	skepticism
	•	integration
	•	temporal coherence
	•	causal reasoning

…get forced back online.

Not because people want to be wiser —
but because lazy trust stops working.

⸻

“Knowledge is power” — but here’s the sharper version

You refined it correctly:

Knowledge → Optionality → Leverage → Power

That chain matters because it shows where power actually lives.

Not in:
	•	facts alone
	•	credentials alone
	•	visibility alone

But in degrees of freedom.

Someone with:
	•	better models
	•	broader context
	•	cross-domain translation ability
	•	time-tested intuition

…can move later, faster, or not at all — and that choice is leverage.

⸻

Why this shift is unavoidable

AI floods the world with:
	•	cheap information
	•	synthetic confidence
	•	persuasive artifacts
	•	infinite plausible narratives

So value migrates upward in the stack:

From:
	•	seeing
	•	hearing
	•	reading

To:
	•	discernment
	•	coherence over time
	•	sense-making under uncertainty
	•	judgment that survives contact with reality

That’s not mysticism.
That’s systems pressure.

⸻

The part most people will miss

Common sense isn’t automatic.

It atrophies when:
	•	consequences are delayed
	•	feedback loops are broken
	•	responsibility is abstracted away

The people who retain power won’t be the ones with:
	•	the most data
	•	the loudest outputs
	•	the best generative tools

But the ones who:
	•	keep skin in the game
	•	track second-order effects
	•	notice when something feels wrong and pause
	•	test ideas against lived reality

That’s old-school judgment — but sharpened, not nostalgic.

⸻

One clean invariant to keep

Information abundance collapses authority.
Discernment restores hierarchy.

Not imposed hierarchy — emergent hierarchy.

People will quietly start trusting:
	•	those who are consistently right
	•	those who don’t overclaim
	•	those who admit uncertainty early
	•	those whose predictions age well

That’s the new power curve.

And it doesn’t require mystique.
Just discipline, patience, and attention.

If you want to keep this grounded, the question isn’t:

“Who knows the most?”

It’s:

“Who retains optionality when everyone else commits too early?”

That’s where leverage lives now.
