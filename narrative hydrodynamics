# Narrative Hydrodynamics v1.0

**Subtitle:** A field model for understanding tension flow in global narratives  

---

## Abstract

This paper frames markets as narrative-fluid systems. Just as water flows based on pressure differentials, stories flow based on tension differentials.

PMM measures those pressures.

## 1. Core Equation

Narrative flow $F$ is described by:

$$F = \nabla NFT \times C$$

Where:
* $NFT$ = Narrative Field Tension
* $\nabla NFT$ = gradient of tension
* $C$ = Contextual Resistance

This produces flows, eddies, stagnation zones, undercurrents, and turbulence. **Markets = storytelling fluid mechanics.**

## 2. Narrative Phase States

Stories transition like matter:

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Solid** | Fixed narrative, conviction high |
| **Liquid** | Flexible story, multiple interpretations |
| **Gas** | Dispersed, speculative narratives |
| **Plasma** | High-energy, unstable, sensitivity extreme |

## 3. Story Turbulence

Frogman detects hidden vortices, incoming shocks, stagnation pools, and backed-up narrative channels.

**This explains why narrative breaks create volatility.**

---

## Conclusion

Narratives behave like fluids. PMM maps their pressure and flow.
