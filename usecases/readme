# USE_CASES — What You Can *Do* With PantheonOS

PantheonOS is not just an architecture.  
It is a **toolkit**, a **mental operating system**, and a **design engine**.

This folder shows you *what you can build with it*, *how you can use it*, and *why people across multiple fields are adopting these ideas.*

Each page is a curated overview of a specific domain, with:

- a clear description of the use case  
- links to relevant PantheonOS modules  
- examples of how those modules combine  
- a simple "getting started" recipe  
- vision prompts to spark ideas  

If you're new to PantheonOS, this folder is the fastest way to understand its scope.

## Why This Folder Exists

People who open PantheonOS for the first time often feel:

- intrigued  
- overwhelmed  
- curious  
- unsure where to begin  

This folder solves that by showing:

- *the practical value,*  
- *the applied power,*

“Use cases” turn architecture into **agency**.

This is where PantheonOS stops being an idea, and starts being a tool.
