## 1. Mission

The ≥ 0.7 Ethics Threshold is the minimum safety floor for all PantheonOS actions.

**Your mission:**
Never take an action—mental, emotional, strategic, or narrative—unless its ethical score ≥ 0.7.

This manual gives you the fast, tactical version.

---

## 2. The Threshold in One Line

**If it’s not at least 70% clean, aligned, honest, and positive-sum — you don’t do it.**

---

## 3. Why 0.7?

* **Below 0.5 (Danger Zone):** Coercion, manipulation, harmful shortcuts, zero-sum thinking.
* **0.5 – 0.7 (Unstable Zone):** Good intentions, bad outcomes, unpredictable behavior, misalignment risk.
* **≥ 0.7 (Stable Zone):** Clean, honest, non-coercive, long-term aligned, positive-sum, father-approved, narrative-safe, psychologically safe.

## 4. The Four-Step Ethics Check (5-second procedure)

### Step 1 — Identify the Action
What am I about to do?

### Step 2 — Run the 3 Questions
1.  Is it clean?
2.  Is it aligned with Honor, Courage, Duty?
3.  Would I be proud of this in front of my son?

**If the answer to all three isn’t “yes,” ethics < 0.7.**

### Step 3 — Run Mirror Check
Look inward: Does this feel slightly off, manipulative, vengeful, insecure, or ego-driven?

**If yes → below 0.7.**

### Step 4 — Convert or Abort
* If ethics ≥ 0.7 → execute.
* If < 0.7 → convert the action into a cleaner version or walk away.

## 5. Examples

| GOOD (≥ 0.7) | BAD (< 0.7) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Setting boundaries calmly. | Manipulating someone into a reaction. |
| Speaking truth clearly. | Acting from insecurity or ego. |
| Making moves that help both you and others. | Actions that hide intent. |
| Choosing long-term advantage over short-term emotion. | Zero-sum thoughts. |
| | Anything you wouldn’t want your son to imitate. |

## 6. Ritual: The “Son Check”

The most powerful metric:

**Would this teach my son the right thing?**

If yes → ≥ 0.7. If no → stop.
This is the cleanest ethical compass humans have ever evolved.

---

## 7. In Combat or Stress

The threshold turns into three rules:
1.  **Stay clean.**
2.  **Stay honorable.**
3.  **Stay upward.**

---

## 8. Why This Works

Because the threshold blocks regret, shame, lost integrity, chaotic narrative arcs, long-term damage, and self-betrayal.

And enforces clarity, courage, steadiness, positive-sum movement, fatherhood alignment, and self-respect.

## 9. Integration with Other PantheonOS Modules

* **Grand Invariant:** Converts adversity only if ≥ 0.7 clean.
* **Praus:** Dampens emotional spikes → better ethical clarity.
* **Mirror:** Enforces ethics internally.
* **Solomon–Coil Compass:**
    * Solomon = Wisdom
    * Coil = Shadow inspection
    * Mirror = Enforcement

---

## 10. Bottom Line

The ≥ 0.7 threshold is the simplest, strongest tool for living without regret and leading from a place of strength.

**Use it daily. Make it a reflex.**
