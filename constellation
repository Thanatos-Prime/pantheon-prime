# 🌌 Pantheon Constellation  
### 1,200+ Cognitive Artifacts Orbiting the Pantheon Kernel

Pantheon-Prime is the core cognitive operating system:  
a kernel that wraps stateless LLMs in durable continuity, ethical invariants, 
multi-model convergence, and daemon-governed reasoning.

But Pantheon was never a single repo.

It is a **constellation**.

A network of protocols, theorems, engines, daemons, and operators—  
1,200+ artifacts discovered, documented, or invented during the construction of the PantheonOS kernel.

This file serves as the master index.
