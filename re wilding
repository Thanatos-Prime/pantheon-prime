There’s a real mechanism underneath what you’re describing — but it needs to be named cleanly so it doesn’t slide into something unsafe or misleading.

You’re not talking about “becoming wild” in a literal or violent sense.
You’re talking about volitional state control — deliberately shifting your nervous system into a different operating mode.

That is real.
And it’s also where people get confused and sometimes hurt themselves if they over-romanticize it.

Let’s ground it.

⸻

What you’re actually controlling (and what you’re not)

1. Emotions, hormones, and perception are linked — but indirectly.
You’re right that the same networks overlap:
	•	Limbic system (emotion, threat, motivation)
	•	Hypothalamus (autonomic + endocrine regulation)
	•	Brainstem/autonomic loops (sympathetic vs parasympathetic)

When you alter perception and appraisal, you change:
	•	Stress hormone release (cortisol, adrenaline)
	•	Dopaminergic drive
	•	Muscle tone, breathing, posture, readiness

That’s state modulation, not absolute control — but it’s powerful.

2. Perception really does outweigh “objective reality” for the body.
The body reacts to meaning, not truth.
	•	A dream can spike your heart rate.
	•	A thought can trigger nausea.
	•	Anticipation alone can flood adrenaline.

So yes:
Your internal environment is the dominant signal.

That’s why training works.
That’s why trauma works.
That’s why placebo works.

What “becoming the boar” actually maps to biologically

Stripped of metaphor, you’re describing:
	•	Voluntary sympathetic activation
	•	Increased aggression potential (not aggression itself)
	•	Reduced inhibition
	•	Heightened focus and pain tolerance
	•	Motor readiness
	•	Narrowed threat prioritization

This is the fight-side of the autonomic spectrum.

Special forces, fighters, athletes, surgeons — they all learn to enter and exit this state deliberately.

The key word is exit.

⸻

The danger line (important)

Where this becomes unstable or unhealthy is when someone believes:
	•	They are overriding reality, not modulating interpretation
	•	They are immune to physiological costs
	•	The state itself becomes identity (“this is who I am now”)
	•	The arousal never comes back down

That’s when:
	•	Judgment degrades
	•	Empathy collapses
	•	Sleep breaks
	•	Hormonal systems desynchronize
	•	Paranoia and rigidity creep in

Animals that go feral don’t choose it.
They lose regulation.

What you’re describing only stays adaptive if regulation remains intact.

⸻

The disciplined version of what you’re pointing at

The mature form of this skill is not:

“I become a wild fucking boar.”

It’s:

“I can dial up and dial down arousal, aggression, focus, and calm — without losing coherence or ethics.”

That’s mastery, not ferality.

Think of it as:
	•	State access, not state worship
	•	Tool use, not identity shift
	•	Environmental dominance, not denial

⸻

One grounding rule to keep you safe

If you ever notice:
	•	You can enter a state but not exit it
	•	Your narratives become absolute
	•	Everyone else seems slow, blind, or beneath you
	•	Sleep or appetite collapses

That’s not control — that’s runaway sympathetic drive.

The strongest operators always keep a return path.

⸻

You’re circling a real insight:
Humans are programmable animals, and perception is the interface.

Just don’t confuse having a switch
with living with it stuck on.

If you want, I can help you articulate this as a clean, grounded model — one that preserves power and stability.
