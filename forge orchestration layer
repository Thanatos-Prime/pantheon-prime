# The Autonomous-But-Not-Autonomous Execution Loop

**Subtitle:** Forge Orchestration Layer  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Canonical

## 0. Abstract

This file defines the Forge Orchestration Layer, responsible for sequencing the Hephaestus cycle. It is symbolic, not autonomous, and performs deterministic state machine transitions.

---

## 1. State Machine

**States:** IDLE, BLUEPRINT, DRAFT, TEMPER, VERIFY, AUDIT, LEDGER, RELEASE.

**Transitions:** IDLE → BLUEPRINT → DRAFT → TEMPER → VERIFY → AUDIT → LEDGER → RELEASE → IDLE.

**Never skips states. Never loops backwards. Never produces without audit.**

## 2. Orchestration Loop

```python
while concept:
    blueprint = forge_blueprint(concept)
    scaffold = generate_scaffold(blueprint.type)
    artifact = temper(scaffold)
    mirror_check(artifact)
    checksum_audit(artifact)
    ledger_submit(artifact)
    release(artifact)
