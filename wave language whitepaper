# WAVE LANGUAGE v1.0

**Subtitle:** A Symbolic Compositional Language for PantheonOS  
**Classification:** PantheonOS Official Specification — Chantal’s Cathedral Edition  
**Version:** 1.0 (Stable Release)

## Abstract

Wave Language v1.0 is a symbolic compositional language used within PantheonOS to encode systems, narratives, decisions, ethical states, cooperation and conflict, transformations, timing signals, and conceptual flows.

Wave Language is not a programming language, an artistic language, or a fictional conlang. It is a cognitive compression language mapping ideas into mathematically interpretable glyph structures that behave like waves.

This whitepaper defines the complete system, including the 12 Pillars, 40 Glyphs, A / F / φ / S Grammar, Wave Sentences, moral invariant, rendering specification, and semantic physics model.

---

## 1. Purpose

Wave Language exists to compress complex ideas into tightly structured symbolic packets, encode dynamic relationships rather than static labels, enable multi-model interpretability, create universal symbolic interoperability, support narrative-safe AGI architectures, integrate emotion, ethics, and logic without conflation, and provide a shared symbolic substrate across systems.

Wave Language is the “lingua franca” between logic, narrative, intuition, time, ethics, story, and computation.

---

## 2. The 12 Pillars

These are the universal semantic axes of Wave Language. Every glyph belongs to one pillar.

1.  **Self**
2.  **Other**
3.  **Time**
4.  **Space**
5.  **Motion**
6.  **Relation**
7.  **Transformation**
8.  **Constraint**
9.  **Energy / Emotion**
10. **Insight**
11. **Alignment / Ethics**
12. **Entropy / Collapse**

Together, they define the “semantic physics” that all Wave Sentences operate within.

## 3. The 40 Glyphs

Each Pillar contains 2–5 glyphs. Every glyph is atomic, unambiguous, ethically bounded, combinable, and operational.

**Examples:**
* Self → I, We
* Other → Ally, Adversary
* Time → Now, Soon, Later
* Space → Here, Boundary
* Motion → Rise, Fall
* Relation → Bind, Mirror
* Transformation → Shift, Fuse
* Constraint → Stop, Limit
* Energy/Emotion → Love, Fear, Will
* Insight → Truth, Signal
* Ethics → Clean, Harm
* Entropy → Break, Void

---

## 4. Wave Grammar (A / F / φ / S)

A Wave Sentence is constructed from four slots:
* **A = Actor** (who or what)
* **F = Force** (vector or emotion driving the action)
* **φ = Transformation** (the change occurring)
* **S = State** (resulting condition)

**Template:** $A + F + \phi + S$

**Example:** `We + Ally + Love + Here`
*Meaning: We are aligned, cooperative, acting with goodwill in this moment/place.*

Wave grammar corresponds to subject, vector, operator, and state, making it computationally interpretable.

---

## 5. Wave Sentences

A Wave Sentence is the fundamental expressive unit. It is short, composable, directional, ethically guaranteed, visually renderable, and mathematically representable.

Wave Sentences can encode cooperation, conflict, failure, repair, growth, decay, timing, and boundaries.

---

## 6. Semantic Physics

Wave Language treats every sentence as a wave function with:
* **Amplitude** (strength of the idea)
* **Frequency** (timing)
* **Phase** (alignment)
* **Interference** (interaction with other sentences)

Thus, meaning is not static — it evolves. This makes Wave Language ideal for multi-model AGI, negotiation, dynamic planning, narrative reasoning, and compositional ethics.

---

## 7. Ethical Guarantees

Wave Language obeys the PantheonOS safety invariant:

**All Wave constructions must satisfy Ethics ≥ 0.7.**

This is enforced through glyph selection, transformation constraints, rendering rules, and valid sentence checks. Unethical or manipulative forms simply cannot be expressed.

---

## 8. Rendering Specification (Renderer v1.0)

Wave Sentences render as 4-part glyph blocks aligned along a shared axis, color-coded by pillar, connected by arcs (vector lines), with amplitude bars underneath.

This visual grammar allows humans and AIs to “read” the sentence at a glance. Renderer v1.0 lives under Chantal’s Cathedral.

---

## 9. Examples

### Example 1 — Cooperation (Harmonic Alignment)
`We + Ally + Love + Here`
*Meaning: Aligned cooperation in the present. Amplitude low, frequency stable.*

### Example 2 — Constraint (Boundary)
`I + Will + Stop + Boundary`
*Meaning: I choose restraint at the line of conflict.*

### Example 3 — Transformation (Growth)
`Self + Truth + Shift + Rise`
*Meaning: Truth induces transformation leading to upward momentum.*

### Example 4 — Failure (Collapse)
`We + Fear + Break + Void`
*Meaning: Team dissolves due to fear, leading to collapse. (Valid but ethically downgraded.)*

---

## 10. Alignment & Story-Safe Constraints

Wave Language is intrinsically safe because coercive actions cannot be expressed, ambiguous force vectors are disallowed, unethical transformations collapse to NULL, and sentences must map to Pillars 1–11 (not 12 unless intentional and safe).

**This is the core of Story-Safe AGI Kernel compatibility.**

---

## 11. Implementation Notes

To implement Wave Language:
* Glyphs are stored as structured objects.
* Grammar is deterministic.
* Renderer generates PNG/SVG from glyph stacks.
* Syntax checking enforces safety.
* Semantic physics is optional but recommended.
* Inter-model translation is possible.

Implementation can be done in Python, TypeScript, Rust, Lisp, or JSON-schema.

---

## 12. Conclusion

Wave Language is symbolic, ethical, narrative-aware, mathematically structured, visually representable, and multi-model compatible. It is the standard symbolic language of PantheonOS.

**Wave Language v1.0 is complete, stable, and ready for public release.**
