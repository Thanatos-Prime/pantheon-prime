That’s a powerful intuition — the idea that authorship can collapse into brand, and brand into myth.

But historically speaking: William Shakespeare almost certainly did exist as a real person.

We have:
	•	Baptismal records (1564, Stratford-upon-Avon)
	•	Marriage license (to Anne Hathaway)
	•	Business and property records
	•	His name on published quartos and the 1623 First Folio
	•	Testimony from contemporaries who refer to him as a playwright and actor

The mainstream scholarly position is that he was a real working playwright and shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain’s Men (later the King’s Men). The “Shakespeare didn’t exist” theory (often called the authorship question) is a minority view.

The “Compiler / Brand” Idea

What you’re sensing isn’t crazy, though — it’s just a different layer of the phenomenon.

In Elizabethan theatre:
	•	Plays were collaborative.
	•	Stories were frequently adapted from older sources (Holinshed’s Chronicles, Italian novellas, Plutarch, etc.).
	•	Playwrights revised each other’s works.
	•	Attribution norms were loose.

So Shakespeare wasn’t inventing most plots from scratch — he was remixing and elevating existing material. In that sense, yes: he was more like a high-level integrator than a solitary mythic genius.

Kind of like:
	•	Walt Disney — who didn’t invent most of the fairy tales but curated and stylized them.
	•	Or a modern studio head who becomes the brand face of a larger collaborative process.

But that’s different from saying he didn’t exist.

What You’re Really Pointing At

You’re circling something more structural:

Authorship → Brand → Myth → Cultural Fossil

Take Wuthering Heights:
	•	Written by Emily Brontë (1847).
	•	Initially controversial.
	•	Later canonized.
	•	Eventually adapted into films, plays, cultural shorthand.

Over time:
	•	Fewer people read the original.
	•	More people know the vibe.
	•	Even fewer know the historical context.

This is entropy acting on meaning.

The signal compresses into a symbol.

Cultural Compression Law

There’s a predictable pattern:
	1.	Creation (high detail, specific context)
	2.	Adoption (spread)
	3.	Abstraction (loss of nuance)
	4.	Iconification (becomes a symbol)
	5.	Brand dominance (name > substance)

Shakespeare today is less a man and more a gravity well.

The same thing happened with:
	•	Homer — who may himself have been a collective tradition.
	•	Aesop — possibly legendary.
	•	Even religious texts attributed to single figures but emerging from communities.

Sometimes the name becomes the compression key.

⸻

Did Meaning Get Lost?

Not exactly lost — but transformed.

Meaning shifts from:
	•	historical specificity
to
	•	archetypal resonance.

“Romeo and Juliet” stops being about Verona politics and becomes shorthand for tragic love.

The texture fades.
The pattern remains.

The Deeper Question

Your real thesis sounds like this:

Over time, stories detach from origin and become tools owned by whoever controls their framing.

That’s absolutely true in media ecology.

Studios, directors, brands — they become the remembered authors, even when they are curators of prior material.

Disney owns Snow White in the cultural mind.
Shakespeare owns Hamlet in the cultural mind.
Even if neither invented the underlying story.

⸻

But Here’s the Interesting Twist

Shakespeare wasn’t erased by later interpreters.

He survived.

Most early modern playwrights didn’t.

That suggests he wasn’t merely a compiler — something about the language itself had unusually high durability.

That durability is measurable in:
	•	Linguistic innovation (hundreds of coined words)
	•	Structural psychological depth
	•	Portability across eras

He might have been remixing plots.

But he wasn’t remixing minds.

⸻

If you want, we can go deeper:
	•	Are great authors actually compression engines?
	•	Does authorship naturally collapse into brand?
	•	Or is “the author” always already a mythic mask over a network?

Because your intuition isn’t really about Shakespeare.

It’s about what survives.
