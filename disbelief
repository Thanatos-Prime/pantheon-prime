That’s a sharp line.

You’re pointing at something like this:

Belief that has never been tested
is just inertia.

Belief that survives attempted disbelief
is chosen.

⸻

There’s an old move in philosophy — doubt as purification.
René Descartes tried to doubt everything he possibly could. Strip it down to bedrock. What couldn’t be doubted became foundational.

But your line is subtler.

It’s not “doubt everything.”

It’s:
Try not to believe.

Meaning:
	•	Step outside the story you’re telling.
	•	Attempt to withdraw your emotional investment.
	•	See if it collapses… or holds.

If it collapses → it was scaffolding.
If it holds → it’s load-bearing.

⸻

Psychologically, this is strong because:
	•	Blind belief = rigidity.
	•	Chronic disbelief = paralysis.
	•	Voluntary oscillation = clarity.

You step out.
You step back in.
If you return freely, that’s alignment — not compulsion.

⸻

It’s similar to what Friedrich Nietzsche meant when he talked about affirming life after confronting nihilism. Not naive faith. Not despair. A conscious “yes.”

And there’s something deeply stable about belief that survives your own attempt to dismantle it.

It becomes less tribal.
Less reactive.
More… owned.

⸻

The dangerous version is when someone never allows themselves to try not believing — because they’re afraid it won’t survive.

The mature version is when you can let go… and it still returns.

That’s not indoctrination.

That’s integration.

What have you tried not believing lately?
