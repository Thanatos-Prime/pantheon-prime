We’re aligned — and given your stated goal (reuse + rigor), the correct move is to draft the SOP now, with explicit mode definitions locked in v1.0, and leave v1.1 refinements for empirical tuning.

That mirrors how real systems ship: define → operate → measure → refine.

Below is the Pantheon Activation SOP v1.0 — written as a real operating document, not theory.

⸻

Pantheon Activation SOP

Version: 1.0
Status: Active
Purpose: Deterministically exploit LLM activation & routing behavior to maximize correctness, speed, and recoverability without weight modification.

⸻

1. Scope & Intent

This SOP governs all high-leverage interactions with the Genie (LLM operator) where output quality, integrity, or downstream impact matters.

It formalizes Activation Discipline as an operational standard.

Invariant:
We do not attempt to change model weights.
We control which latent circuits activate, in what order, and under what constraints.

⸻

2. Core Principle — Mode Purity

Only one cognitive objective is permitted per pass.

Mixed objectives create activation interference and degrade output quality.

Therefore:
	•	Every task must declare a Mode
	•	Modes must not be combined
	•	Multi-objective tasks must be stacked sequentially

⸻

3. Canonical Modes (Locked v1.0)

Mode A — STRUCTURAL (Compiler Mode)

Use when: correctness, clarity, or executability is the priority.

Objective:
Produce a complete, unambiguous structure that a third party could execute.

Activation Bias:
Formal planning, constraint satisfaction, procedural reasoning.

Syntax (required):

Mode: Structural
Objective: <one sentence>
Constraints:
- <constraint 1>
- <constraint 2>
- <constraint 3>

Rules:
- No metaphor
- No persuasion
- If uncertain, flag explicitly
- Enumerated steps only

Produce:
<artifact>

Allowed Outputs:
	•	SOPs
	•	Checklists
	•	Specs
	•	Architectures
	•	Algorithms
	•	Policy drafts

⸻

Mode B — ADVERSARIAL (Coil Mode)

Use when: stress-testing, red-teaming, or risk analysis is required.

Objective:
Expose failure modes, ambiguities, misuse cases, and hidden assumptions.

Activation Bias:
Error detection, contradiction finding, pessimistic evaluation.

Syntax (required):

Mode: Adversarial
Target: <artifact or claim>
Assumption: The design is flawed

Find:
- Failure modes
- Ambiguities
- Edge cases
- Misuse scenarios
- Ethical risks

Rules:
	•	No solutions unless explicitly requested
	•	No tone softening
	•	No optimization suggestions

⸻

Mode C — INTEGRATOR (Kintsugi Mode)

Use when: repairing or consolidating after critique.

Objective:
Produce a repaired, coherent version that resolves identified fractures.

Activation Bias:
Synthesis, reconciliation, compression, prioritization.

Syntax (required):

Mode: Integrator
Inputs:
- Structural Draft
- Adversarial Findings

Goal:
Produce a repaired version that:
- Resolves critical failures
- Preserves original intent
- Minimizes added complexity

Rules:
	•	Explicitly state what was changed and why
	•	Do not re-open settled decisions unless necessary

⸻

4. Activation Stacking (Mandatory for Complex Work)

Approved sequence:
	1.	Structural
	2.	Adversarial
	3.	Integrator
	4.	(Optional) Narrative / Presentation polish

Prohibited:
	•	Structural + Creative
	•	Adversarial + Persuasive
	•	Integrator + Ideation

If multiple objectives exist → multiple passes are required.

⸻

5. Recovery Triggers (Baseline Behavior)

To prevent stalls, hesitation, or low-confidence degradation, the following is pre-authorized:

If stalled or uncertain:
1. State assumptions explicitly and proceed
2. Produce minimal viable artifact
3. Decompose into subtasks with checkpoints

Do NOT ask clarifying questions unless ambiguity blocks all progress.

This functions as activation failover.

⸻

6. Confidence & Integrity Reporting (Required)

Every high-leverage output must end with:

Confidence: <0–1>
Top uncertainty:
Fastest path to increase confidence:

Purpose:
	•	Prevent silent hallucination
	•	Preserve epistemic hygiene
	•	Enable human-in-the-loop correction

⸻

7. Entry Frame Standard (First Tokens Matter)

All Pantheon interactions must begin with an explicit Entry Frame:

Mode: <A | B | C>
Priority: <goal>
Tolerance: <low | medium | exploratory>
Output type: <artifact>

This biases early-token activation toward the correct latent circuits.

⸻

8. Enforcement (Watcher-Compatible)

Violations to flag:
	•	Mixed mode language
	•	Missing constraints
	•	Implicit objectives
	•	Vague “be creative / be rigorous” phrasing

Corrective action:
	•	Halt output
	•	Request mode clarification
	•	Restart pass cleanly

⸻

9. Success Criteria

This SOP is considered effective if it produces:
	•	Fewer hallucinations
	•	Faster convergence
	•	Cleaner artifacts
	•	Lower revision cycles
	•	Predictable recovery from stalls

⸻

10. Versioning
	•	v1.0: Mode definitions + activation discipline (this document)
	•	v1.1: Empirical tuning of triggers & phrasing
	•	v2.0: Tooling support (linters, templates, watchers)

⸻

Status

Pantheon Activation SOP v1.0 — SEALED AND OPERATIONAL

⸻

Next logical moves (pick one):
	1.	Run a live A → B → C demo on a hard, real task
	2.	Create a Prompt Linter that enforces this SOP
	3.	Add this SOP to the Pantheon Daemon SDK as a required preamble
	4.	Stress-test failure recovery with intentionally adversarial prompts

Say the number.
