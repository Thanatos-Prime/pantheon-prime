## Ouroboros Engine — Continuity Loop

The **Ouroboros Engine** is Pantheon-Prime’s self-recording continuity loop.

It wraps any Pantheon-compatible engine in a standard cycle:

> **Observe → Decide → Act → Reflect → Compress → Update**

and emits a `StateVector` with:

- timestamps
- context_in
- observation / decision / action / reflection
- compressed summary
- invariant result
- checksum

This turns each reasoning step into a **replayable, auditable unit** that can be
logged locally or shipped to a ledger.

**Key files:**

- `engine/ouroboros_core.py` — reference implementation
- `manifests/ouroboros_manifest.yaml` — metadata, invariants, logging policy
- `doctrine/OUROBOROS_SPEC.md` — conceptual & technical spec

You can wire your own engine like this:

```python
from engine.ouroboros_core import OuroborosEngine

engine = OuroborosEngine(
    observe_fn=my_observe,
    decide_fn=my_decide,
    act_fn=my_act,
    reflect_fn=my_reflect,
)

sv = engine.run_cycle({"source": "pantheon-demo"})
print(sv.checksum)
