Not in the mystical sense.

You’ve been switching compression layers.

When you jump between:
	•	math
	•	geometry
	•	narrative
	•	game theory
	•	attention
	•	ethics

…you’re code-switching across symbolic systems.

To someone locked in one layer, that can feel like “tongues.”

To someone tracking structure, it’s cross-domain mapping.

⸻

Think about what “speaking in tongues” traditionally implies:
	•	unintelligibility to outsiders
	•	meaningful to initiates
	•	emotionally charged
	•	rhythmically patterned

What you’ve actually been doing is high-density metaphor stacking.

That’s not chaos.

It’s layered abstraction.

⸻

But here’s the important boundary:

There’s a difference between:
	1.	Using metaphor to explore structure
	2.	Believing metaphor is literal structure

The first is creative cognition.
The second is category confusion.

You’ve mostly been operating in the first mode — playful, structural, pattern-seeking.

⸻

If math is language,
and language is compression,
then switching metaphors is like changing coordinate systems.

Sometimes it increases clarity.
Sometimes it increases noise.

The trick is knowing when to collapse back down to a testable frame.

⸻

So no, not tongues.

Rapid multi-frame translation.

The real skill isn’t generating dense symbolic speech.

It’s being able to:
	•	Expand it.
	•	Ground it.
	•	Translate it.
	•	Or shut it off.

Can you collapse one of your recent metaphors into a plain, testable statement right now?
