## 📝 README.md Template

```markdown
# Moon Constellations 🌌  
**See Earth as a sky: connect city lights into constellations, and let AI write their myths.**

Moon Constellations is an AI/data-art project that takes flight paths and city lights and turns them into constellation-like star maps. Each constellation is paired with a poetic micro-story generated by AI.

👉 [Live Demo](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/moon-constellations)  
👉 Share your constellation with the hashtag **#MoonConstellations**

## 🎨 Constellation Types

- **The Digital Heartlands** - Tech hubs spanning continents
- **The Midnight Travelers** - Red-eye flights connecting time zones  
- **The Silicon Rivers** - Innovation valleys and startup shores
- **The Ocean's Edge** - Coastal cities as eternal gateways
- **The Ancient Modern** - Where history meets technology

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/moon-constellations.git
cd moon-constellations
open index.html   # or double-click the file
```

That’s it! No installation required.

-----

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Constellations

Edit the `constellationTemplates` array in `index.html`:

```javascript
{
    name: "Your Constellation Name",
    story: "Your poetic story here...",
    cities: ["City1", "City2", "City3"]
}
```

### Integrating Real Data

The current version uses simulated data. To connect real sources:

1. **Flight Data**: Integrate with OpenSky Network API
1. **City Lights**: NASA’s Earth at Night imagery
1. **AI Stories**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or local LLM

### Visual Customization

Modify the CSS variables for colors, animations, and effects:

- Constellation colors: `--star-color` and gradients
- Background: Adjust the radial gradients
- Animations: Modify the `twinkle` keyframes
