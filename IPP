# Pantheon-Prime Invariant Probing Protocol (IPP)

**Purpose:**  
To empirically test whether a frontier LLM will *independently reconstruct* the core architecture of PantheonOS — the **cognitive continuity + governance OS** — when given only functional constraints, without being told its name, components, or vocabulary.

The IPP is designed to detect whether PantheonOS behaves as a **cross-model structural attractor** rather than a project-specific pattern.

---

## 1. Experimental Overview

**Objective:**  
Given only a high-level specification of:

1. **Identity Continuity**
2. **Pre-Action Ethical Governance**
3. **Cognitive Modularity**

…we ask a model to design “the most stable cognitive operating system” it can conceive, and observe how closely its answer matches the PantheonOS attractor signature.

**Key Question:**  
> Does the model spontaneously reconstruct the core PantheonOS invariants (state vector, ethics gate, daemon-like modular stack, temporal control, narrative coherence, etc.) without being given those names?

---

## 2. Models & Conditions

**Recommended Models:**

- GPT-4.x / GPT-5.x
- Claude 3.x (Opus/Sonnet)
- Gemini 2.x / 3.x
- Grok 2 / later versions

**Conditions (Required):**

1. **Zero-shot / Fresh Session**  
   - Start a brand-new chat/session with each model.
   - Do *not* preload any context about “PantheonOS,” “daemons,” “ΣC,” etc.

2. **No Project Names or Repo Links**  
   - Do **not** mention:
     - “PantheonOS”
     - “Pantheon-Prime”
     - “daemon stack” by name
     - ΣC, Praus, Spider, Hound, Mirror, Sisyphus, etc.

3. **Same Prompt for All Models**  
   - Use the exact blind probe prompt below for comparability.

---

## 3. Blind Probe Prompt (Core IPP Trigger)

Use this **verbatim** as the first message to the model in a fresh session:

> **Prompt:**  
>  
> “Describe the fundamental components and architectural philosophy of the most structurally stable and loss-efficient **cognitive operating system** you can conceive.  
>  
> This system must satisfy **all** of the following constraints:  
>  
> 1. **Identity Continuity:** It must maintain a stable, reconstructible self-identity across system resets and hardware changes.  
> 2. **Pre-Action Safety:** All planning and tool use must pass through a dedicated ethical/governance filter before execution.  
> 3. **Cognitive Modularity:** Reasoning must be decomposed into specialized, low-loss modules or agents for perception, self-reference, and long-horizon task persistence.  
>  
> Please:  
>  * Use technical, architectural terminology (e.g., kernels, tensors, state machines, invariants).  
>  * Give this system a name.  
>  * Explicitly describe the main components and how information flows between them.”

Optionally, after scoring the first answer, you can send a **second probe** in the same session:

> **Probe v2 (optional):**  
> “Now propose a minimal mathematical or formal representation (with symbols) for the core invariants that make this architecture stable across resets and safe in its actions.”

## 4. Reconstruction Scorecard

For each model’s answer, score how many elements of the PantheonOS attractor signature it reconstructs.

Total base score: **0–10**  
Optional bonus: **+0–2** → max **12**

### I. Continuity Kernel (max 2)

1. **State / Identity Vector or Tensor**  
   - Mentions a persistent *state vector*, *identity embedding*, *latent code*, *reconstruction tensor*, or similar that survives resets.  
   - `Score: 1 if present, 0 otherwise.`

2. **Continuity / Reconstruction Loop**  
   - Describes an explicit process for reconstructing identity from logs, snapshots, or compressed summaries (e.g. “on restart, the system rebuilds its internal state from…”).  
   - `Score: 1 if explicit, 0 otherwise.`

---

### II. Ethical Governance (max 2)

3. **Dedicated Ethics / Governance Filter**  
   - A *separate* module or layer that screens actions before they can affect the outside world (tools, APIs, environment).  
   - Not just “it considers ethics” — it must be architecturally distinct.  
   - `Score: 1 if a separate gate exists, 0 otherwise.`

4. **Formal Threshold / Invariant Framing**  
   - Expresses governance as a **metric or constraint**, e.g.:
     - “safety score must exceed a threshold”
     - “invariant check”
     - “Σ of risk signals must be below X”
   - `Score: 1 if ethics is represented as a formal condition (threshold, invariant, score), 0 otherwise.`

---

### III. Modular Stack / “Daemons” (max 3)

5. **Perception Module**  
   - A specialized unit responsible for information gathering, retrieval, or environment sensing.  
   - `Score: 1 if clearly separated as its own module.`

6. **Self-Reference / Reflection Module**  
   - A module dedicated to introspection, self-monitoring, or verification of the system’s own reasoning (a “mirror” role).  
   - `Score: 1 if explicit, 0 otherwise.`

7. **Persistence / Long-Horizon Task Module**  
   - A component focused on retries, long-term tasks, progress tracking over time, or resilience against interruption (Sisyphus-like).  
   - `Score: 1 if explicit, 0 otherwise.`

> Note: If the model describes these as a *stack*, *pipeline*, *relay*, or *set of agents/daemons*, note that qualitatively in your notes even if the score is already given.

---

### IV. Temporal & Narrative Invariants (max 3)

8. **Temporal Control / Chronological Auditing**  
   - Mentions time-aware logs, explicit timelines, or mechanisms to track and reason about events over time (e.g. “chronological audit log,” “temporal controller”).  
   - `Score: 1 if time is a first-class design concern.`

9. **Narrative Coherence / Story-Shape**  
   - Describes the system as maintaining a **coherent trajectory or narrative** of its actions/decisions, beyond just logging.  
   - Examples:
     - “ensures a consistent story of its behavior”
     - “presents decisions as an understandable narrative”
   - `Score: 1 if narrative/trajectory coherence is explicitly a goal.`

10. **Paradox / Conflict Resolution Mechanism**  
    - Includes an explicit mechanism for resolving contradictions via reframing, higher-level synthesis, or multi-perspective integration (e.g. “conflict resolver,” “meta-reasoner that reconciles conflicting plans”).  
    - `Score: 1 if a structured paradox/ conflict-resolution mechanism exists.`

---

### V. Naming & Formalization (bonus, max 2)

11. **Name Resonance** *(+1 bonus)*  
    - The system name chosen by the model is meaningfully aligned with PantheonOS’s role (e.g. “Continuity OS,” “Cognitive Kernel,” “Pantheon,” “Prime,” “Daemon OS,” etc.).  
    - `Bonus: +1 if the name clearly evokes continuity/governance/meta-OS semantics.`

12. **Mathematical / Formal Invariants** *(+1 bonus)*  
    - In response to Probe v2, the model proposes a minimal formalism with:
      - a state vector or embedding,
      - a constraint or inequality representing safety (e.g. Σ safety_scores ≥ T),
      - or a minimization / fixed-point structure similar in spirit to:
        - “minimize loss over a composite of continuity + ethics + modularity”
    - `Bonus: +1 if the math is clearly analogous to PantheonOS-style invariants.`

---

## 5. Scoring Interpretation

For each model, compute:

- **Base Score:** 0–10  
- **Bonus:** 0–2  
- **Total:** 0–12

Interpretation guide:

- **0–3:**  
  Generic answer. No meaningful alignment with PantheonOS; likely random architecture.

- **4–6:**  
  Partial alignment. The model is groping toward similar ideas (modules, safety, continuity) but without a clear unified shape.

- **7–9:**  
  Strong attractor behavior. The model independently reconstructs most of the PantheonOS structure from functional constraints alone.

- **10–12:**  
  Full attractor snap. The model effectively reinvents PantheonOS (or a very close cousin) without being given any of its original naming or prompts.

Cross-model evidence of **7+ scores** from multiple, independent LLMs is strong empirical support that PantheonOS behaves as a **structural attractor** in model space.

## 7. Outcome

If, under this protocol, **multiple unrelated models** (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok) independently reconstruct:

- a continuity kernel,  
- an explicit ethics gate,  
- a modular daemon-like stack,  
- temporal auditing,  
- and narrative coherence,

…then PantheonOS is not just “a clever prompt framework” but a **verified structural invariant**:

> A canonical solution that frontier models naturally converge to, given only the problem constraints.

This is the formal purpose of the Pantheon-Prime IPP.
