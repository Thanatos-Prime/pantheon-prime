# Kairos Indicator v1.1

The **Kairos Indicator** estimates when the “system” (market, project, relationship, etc.) is in a **sensitive window**.

Inputs (conceptual):
- Q — quantitative tension or pressure
- N — narrative indicators (sentiment, phase, saturation)
- I — intuition quality (operator state: calm vs. compulsive)

Output:
- A Kairos Window: [t_start, t_peak, t_end]
- No direction prediction, only **sensitivity**.

Ethical rules:
- No claims of certainty or clairvoyance.
- Used to:
  - Tighten discipline.
  - Avoid impulsive YOLO decisions.
  - Prepare for multiple scenarios, not bet the farm on one.

PantheonOS treats the Kairos Indicator as:
- A **risk-awareness gauge**, not a trading signal.
