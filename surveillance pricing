Short answer: you’re right to be alarmed. Surveillance pricing (a.k.a. algorithmic or personalized pricing based on personal data) undermines fairness, consent, and market trust. There is a strong case for banning it—or at minimum imposing strict bright-line prohibitions.

⸻

What “surveillance pricing” actually is

Surveillance pricing uses behavioral, biometric, demographic, or inferred data (location, device, browsing history, urgency signals, income proxies, even mood) to charge different people different prices for the same good or service, without meaningful consent or transparency.

This goes beyond normal price differences (sales, coupons, bulk discounts). The key distinction is covert extraction of personal data to estimate your willingness or desperation to pay.

⸻

Why it’s fundamentally harmful

1. It destroys the concept of a fair market

Markets rely on shared price signals. When every consumer sees a different price based on hidden surveillance, price loses its coordinating function. You no longer have a market—only individualized exploitation.

⸻

2. It punishes vulnerability

Algorithms don’t just find “what you’ll pay”; they find when you are weakest:
	•	late at night
	•	after repeated searches
	•	during emergencies
	•	when financially stressed

That’s not efficiency—that’s automated coercion.

⸻

3. It recreates redlining in digital form

Even if protected traits aren’t explicitly used, proxies (ZIP code, device type, browsing patterns) reliably reproduce discrimination by:
	•	race
	•	income
	•	disability
	•	age

This creates de facto discrimination without accountability.

⸻

4. There is no meaningful consent

“Accept cookies” ≠ consent to price manipulation.
Consumers are not informed, cannot opt out, and cannot verify whether they are being treated fairly.

That fails every serious definition of informed consent.

⸻

5. It erodes trust at civilizational scale

Once people suspect prices are personalized:
	•	they stop trusting businesses
	•	they waste time gaming systems
	•	they disengage from markets

That’s systemic inefficiency, not innovation.

⸻

This is not hypothetical

Investigations and reporting have already shown:
	•	higher prices shown to users on expensive devices
	•	price shifts based on browsing history and urgency
	•	dynamic pricing tied to location and timing

Regulators in the EU and US have acknowledged the risk, but enforcement is lagging behind deployment.

⸻

What should be banned outright

Hard bans (non-negotiable):
	•	Pricing based on personal data, inferred traits, or behavioral profiling
	•	Prices adjusted based on urgency, stress, or repeated searching
	•	Any pricing model not auditable by regulators

Allowed (with guardrails):
	•	Time-limited public sales
	•	Volume discounts
	•	Transparent loyalty programs with fixed, published rules

The rule should be simple:

If two customers are buying the same thing at the same time, the price must not depend on who they are.

⸻

Who should act (now)
	•	Legislatures (consumer protection & antitrust law)
	•	Regulators like Federal Trade Commission
	•	Data protection authorities enforcing laws like General Data Protection Regulation
	•	Courts treating covert price discrimination as unfair and deceptive practice

⸻

Why urgency matters

Once surveillance pricing becomes normalized, it will be:
	•	extremely hard to unwind
	•	embedded deep in AI systems
	•	defended as “optimization”

This is one of those moments where delay equals permission.

⸻

Bottom line

Surveillance pricing is:
	•	economically corrosive
	•	ethically indefensible
	•	technologically irreversible once entrenched

Banning it isn’t anti-market.
It’s pro-market, pro-fairness, and pro-human agency.

If you want, I can:
	•	draft a one-page policy proposal
	•	write language for a ballot initiative
	•	or map this cleanly into existing consumer-protection law so it’s enforceable immediately
