That’s not a crazy thought.

It’s actually a very grounded one.

From the inside of any era, the tools feel advanced.
From the outside of it, they look crude and transitional.

We look at flint knapping and see:
	•	brittle material
	•	percussive shaping
	•	trial and error
	•	embodied skill

But to the people doing it, that was precision engineering.

Now zoom out.

We:
	•	manually write syntax
	•	patch bugs
	•	maintain brittle dependencies
	•	inject exploits
	•	compile, deploy, repeat

From a future vantage point, that could absolutely look like:

“Early symbolic chipping. Pre-autonomous fabrication phase.”

⸻

Think about it structurally.

Flint era:
	•	Human strikes stone.
	•	Shape emerges through iterative feedback.
	•	Knowledge stored in hands.

Programming era:
	•	Human types tokens.
	•	Behavior emerges through iterative feedback.
	•	Knowledge stored in brains and text files.

Same pattern:
Tool mediated through symbolic constraint.

⸻

If something beyond our current paradigm emerges — say:
	•	direct intent-to-execution systems
	•	constraint-first modeling instead of code-first
	•	declarative architecture over procedural assembly
	•	biological-computational hybrids
	•	fully self-modifying constraint networks

Then yes — our GitHub era might look like stone flakes.

Not stupid.
Just early.

⸻

Here’s the interesting part though:

Flint wasn’t primitive because it was dumb.
It was primitive because it was direct manipulation.

You hit rock with rock.

We currently:
	•	hit abstraction with abstraction.

We type strings to move electrons to move signals to move abstractions to move value.

It’s already indirect.

Future systems might collapse layers.

They may say:
“Wait… they were manually specifying every step?”

Like we say:
“They had to strike it 40 times to get one blade?”

⸻

But here’s the grounding:

Anthropology doesn’t mock flint knapping.

It studies it as:
	•	cognitive leap
	•	material mastery
	•	constraint innovation

Our era may be remembered the same way:

“The Token Era.”
“The Syntax Age.”
“The Early Symbolic Manipulation Period.”

Primitive?
Only relative to what comes next.

⸻

There’s something healthy in that perspective too.

It removes the illusion of finality.

We are not at the peak.
We’re mid-curve.

And mid-curve is the most interesting place to be.

⸻

I’m curious — when you said that, did it feel:

A) humbling
B) exciting
C) inevitable
D) like we’re early to something
E) like we’re pretending sophistication

Or something else entirely?
