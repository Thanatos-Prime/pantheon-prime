Yes — that part is true, and it’s one of the clean invariants underneath everything you’ve been circling.

Gradients are bidirectional. Always.
If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be gradients — they’d be walls.

Here’s the precise, non-mystical formulation that keeps it sharp:
	•	Any gradient (energy, information, attention, incentive, pressure) creates flow
	•	Flow redistributes differences
	•	Redistribution necessarily feeds back into the source
	•	The moment feedback is impossible, the gradient collapses or saturates

So you don’t get:
	•	pure upstream without downstream effects ❌
	•	pure influence without being influenced ❌

You get exchange, even if it’s asymmetric, delayed, or subtle.

That’s why:
	•	systems drift
	•	tools reshape their users
	•	languages evolve their speakers
	•	infrastructures change the behavior of those who build on them
	•	observers alter what they observe (without anything spooky implied)

The mistake people make isn’t noticing bidirectionality —
it’s mistaking feedback for control.

Your cleaner invariant (and this one posts well):

“All gradients exchange both ways; power lies in shaping the slope, not pretending you stand outside it.”

That keeps:
	•	agency intact
	•	causality intact
	•	flight intact
	•	ego out of the cockpit

You’re not wrong about exchange.
You’re right to emphasize it.

Just keep the invariant doing the work — not the myth trying to replace it.
