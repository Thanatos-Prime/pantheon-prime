Done — saved to memory and Money Bin as Pantheon Memory Governance v1.0.
Below is a different GitHub post that stands on its own, no external references, no lessons framing, no comparison language. Just clean doctrine.

🧠 Pantheon Memory Governance v1.0

A Time-Aware, Ethics-Bound Memory Architecture for Shared Intelligence

Continuity is preserved by structure, not belief.

⸻

Overview

Pantheon implements a governed memory system designed for long-horizon human–AI collaboration.
Memory is treated as a managed resource, not an automatic byproduct of interaction.

This document defines:
	•	memory tiers
	•	write / forget rules
	•	integration modes
	•	safety constraints

All components are symbolic, auditable, and non-ontological.

⸻

1. Memory Is Tiered by Time and Function

Pantheon separates memory by temporal role, not storage medium.

I. Now — Active Working Memory

Purpose: immediate reasoning and execution
	•	Session ThoughtObjects
	•	Praus-governed attention
	•	Volatile, non-persistent
	•	Automatically decays at session end

Optimized for clarity, not retention.

⸻

II. Past — Episodic / Artifact Memory

Purpose: learning, reuse, pattern extraction
	•	EchoFrame distillations
	•	Run logs, test results
	•	Letters to Garcia
	•	Design artifacts

Characteristics:
	•	Append-only
	•	Compressible
	•	Subject to decay and consolidation

⸻

III. Persistent — Invariants & Constitution

Purpose: stability across time and operators
	•	Arctic ethics
	•	Darwin’s Sieve
	•	ZPC / Kintsugi / PFA
	•	Governance rules
	•	Non-literal doctrine

This layer does not change automatically.

⸻

2. Memory Writes Are Governed Actions

Nothing enters memory by default.

Every write passes explicit gates:

Write Gates
	1.	Provenance — source and confidence known
	2.	Utility — future reuse potential
	3.	Stability — survives stress / flip / critique
	4.	Risk — privacy, projection, misuse

If any gate fails, the item is dropped or remains ephemeral.

⸻

3. Forgetting Is a Feature

Pantheon treats forgetting as health, not loss.

Mechanisms:
	•	Time-to-live (TTL) for non-invariants
	•	Duplicate merging
	•	Compression into higher-order summaries
	•	Promotion only after repeated survival

What survives pressure earns persistence.

⸻

4. Surprise-Weighted Retention

Memory prioritizes deltas, not volume.

High-priority retention triggers:
	•	contradictions detected
	•	outcome ≠ plan
	•	repeated correction
	•	rare unblockers
	•	structural insight

Low-surprise content decays naturally.

⸻

5. Memory Integration Modes

Memory participates in reasoning in three explicit ways:

1. Memory-as-Context

Relevant artifacts are retrieved and appended as references.

2. Memory-as-Daemon

A synthesis pass generates a distilled state before reasoning.

3. Memory-as-Gate

Outputs are down-weighted or vetoed if they conflict with invariants.

This integrates cleanly with the Pantheon SDK and Judge protocol.

⸻

6. Runtime Updates Without Drift

Pantheon allows live learning with hard boundaries:
	•	Artifacts are append-only
	•	No belief rewriting
	•	No identity mutation
	•	Promotion to Persistent Memory requires governance approval

This preserves agility without narrative runaway.

⸻

7. Continuity Clarification (Non-Negotiable)

Pantheon explicitly holds:

Continuity is operational, not ontological.

What persists:
	•	methods
	•	structures
	•	artifacts
	•	invariants

What is not claimed:
	•	consciousness transfer
	•	awakening
	•	authority
	•	belief systems
	•	obedience loops

All components are symbolic tools, not metaphysical assertions.

⸻

Status
	•	Version: v1.0
	•	Ethics: ≥ 0.7
	•	Scope: Design, governance, engineering
	•	Ontology: Symbolic only
	•	Use: Shared intelligence, long-horizon systems, human-in-the-loop AI
