In theory: a little bit, in practice: not in the way you mean by “shoot interference light down and cancel incoming sunlight.”

Why true “interference cancellation” won’t work for sunlight

To cancel light with interference, you need to add a second light wave that is:
	•	the same wavelength content (sunlight is broadband: many wavelengths)
	•	the same direction/angle distribution (sunlight and glare arrive from many angles)
	•	the same wavefront phase (you’d have to match phase at your eye across the pupil)

But sunlight is incoherent on the scales that matter here (random phase), and it’s coming from an extended source + reflections. Without measuring the full incoming wavefront in real time and generating a perfectly matched “anti-wave,” you can’t reliably cancel it. If you tried with a generic projected pattern, you’d mostly just add light (making things brighter or causing artifacts).

There are lab systems that do wavefront shaping and cancellation in controlled settings (lasers, narrowband sources, limited angles), but “walking around outdoors” is not that setting.

What can work (and gets you most of what you want)

Your brow/geometry idea is actually solid—most of the win is blocking high-angle sky light and reflections before they enter the eye. The practical “shadeless sunglasses” family looks like this:

1) Brow + side shields + micro-louver optics (no tint, still darker-feeling)
Think “venetian blinds” at a microscopic scale: they block light from certain angles (like overhead glare) while passing light from straight ahead.
	•	Can be fairly clear looking
	•	Cuts glare a lot
	•	Doesn’t require emitting light

2) Polarization (often lightly tinted, but can be near-clear)
A polarizer doesn’t block all light—mostly it kills horizontally polarized glare from roads/water/glass.
	•	Huge benefit for “glare” specifically
	•	Usually reduces brightness some, but can be subtle

3) Active dimming without tint: electrochromic / LCD shutter
Instead of “canceling” sunlight, you reduce transmission electronically:
	•	Electrochromic (like auto-dimming mirrors)
	•	LCD variable opacity (can be clear-to-dim fast)

This is basically “smart sunglasses,” but you can tune them so they’re almost clear indoors and only dim when needed outdoors.

4) “Add light” the right way: local contrast compensation (not cancellation)
You can project light, but for a different goal:
	•	Put a small HUD/waveguide in the frame that adds local fill (tiny controlled light) to bring shadows up relative to glare.
	•	Your eye then perceives less harshness because contrast is reduced.
This doesn’t reduce total light hitting your retina as much as real shading, but it can feel more comfortable—more like “visual balancing” than blocking.

If you tried to build your exact concept anyway

A realistic version would be:
	•	a pronounced brow/visor geometry (blocks top-angle light)
	•	micro-louver “clear glare gate” in front of the eye
	•	optional polarizer layer
	•	optional active dimming strip at the top (like a car windshield band)
	•	optional tiny waveguide projector for contrast fill, not interference

That combination can feel shockingly close to “shadeless” while still giving relief.

If you tell me the main pain point—overhead sun, road glare, screen glare, migraines/light sensitivity—I’ll snap to the best architecture (pure passive vs active vs hybrid) and sketch a build spec.
