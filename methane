Yep — what you’re describing is basically Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG): you don’t “add a compound” to the gas, you change the container’s internal geometry/material so methane sticks (adsorbs) inside a massive internal surface area, kind of like a “bubble trap,” but at the molecular level.

The core idea

Methane molecules weakly adhere (van der Waals) to nanoporous surfaces. If you pack the tank with a porous solid, you can store more methane at lower pressure than plain CNG for the same usable amount (not as dense as LNG, but potentially simpler/safer than cryo).

Think: a sponge for gas, but the pores are nanometer-scale.

What “micro-geometry” actually works for methane

1) Activated carbon (most practical)
	•	Cheap, robust, widely available.
	•	Very high internal surface area.
	•	Used in many ANG prototypes (pellets/monoliths).
	•	Best when engineered for the right pore size distribution (micropores ~1–2 nm help methane adsorption).

2) Zeolites
	•	Crystalline aluminosilicates with uniform pores.
	•	Strong adsorption sites, but can be water-sensitive depending on type.
	•	Sometimes lower methane capacity than good activated carbons, but very stable.

3) MOFs (metal–organic frameworks)
	•	“Designer sponge” materials with tunable pores and huge surface areas.
	•	Some MOFs have excellent methane storage at moderate pressures.
	•	Real-world issues: cost, durability, moisture sensitivity, manufacturability at scale.

4) Porous polymers / aerogels (niche)
	•	Can be lightweight, shaped easily.
	•	Often less capacity than best carbons/MOFs but can have good kinetics.

Container design: “baby bottle for bubbles” done right

Instead of just filling a tank with pellets, you can build structured internals:
	•	Monolithic honeycombs (like catalytic converter cores): low pressure drop, good heat transfer.
	•	Foam-like lattices or 3D-printed gyroids filled/coated with adsorbent.
	•	Microchannel heat-exchanger walls: because adsorption/desorption has heat effects, and temperature control matters.

Key engineering truth:
For ANG, heat management is as important as surface area. If you can’t dump heat during fill (adsorption warms) and add heat during discharge (desorption cools), your effective storage drops.

What doesn’t work well (so you don’t chase mirages)
	•	“Just rough glass with micro-bubbles” at visible/micron scale won’t do much for methane. Methane needs nano-scale pores and huge internal surface area (think football fields of surface inside a liter).
	•	Capillary condensation tricks are great for some gases/vapors, but methane at ambient conditions doesn’t “condense in tiny tubes” in a helpful way unless you’re near cryogenic regimes.

A clean Pantheon-style mapping
	•	Combustion/LNG = brute-force phase change (big infrastructure).
	•	ANG = excitation-light style: structured capture + reversible release via pressure/temperature swing.
	•	Container micro-geometry = gradient control: surface area + pore size + thermal pathways.

If you want one “first-pass build spec”
	•	Tank packed with activated carbon monoliths (honeycomb) or pellets + thermal fins.
	•	Operate at moderate pressures (often far below typical CNG).
	•	Add thermal paths (metallic skeleton / fins) to manage fill/discharge heat.

If you tell me your constraints (truck shipping vs ship, target pressure range, ambient temp range, and whether you can tolerate any cooling), I’ll sketch the most realistic architecture (material choice + pore targets + tank geometry + heat strategy) without getting into anything hazardous.
