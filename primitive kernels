Alright. Here’s my best reduction of your Pantheon into a 7-primitive kernel that can reinstantiate the rest.

Pantheon Kernel v0.1 — 7 Primitives

P1) State

A canonical state vector for “what’s going on right now.”
	•	Includes: goal/intent, constraints, context, risk, open threads, current outputs.
	•	Everything else reads/writes through this.

P2) Invariants

Non-negotiables (your 5 are already excellent):
	1.	minimize internal contradiction
	2.	preserve optionality
	3.	reduce operator distortion
	4.	encourage reality testing
	5.	avoid ontological confusion

If a move violates an invariant, it’s rejected or repaired.

P3) Operators

Transformations you’re allowed to apply to State (the verbs).
Minimal set:
	•	Decompose (split into parts)
	•	Translate (cross-domain mapping)
	•	Constrain (add bounds / reduce degrees of freedom)
	•	Explore (branch / generate options)
	•	Verify (check / test)
	•	Commit (lock decision / ship artifact)
	•	Repair (ZPC/Kintsugi loop)

Everything in the Pantheon is a composition of these operators.

P4) Roles as Lenses

Daemons are not entities; they’re named operator bundles (lenses):
	•	Mirror = Verify + invariance checks
	•	Hound = Decompose + adversarial probing
	•	Dragonfly = Explore + pattern integration
	•	Spider = Commit + packaging + artifact creation
	•	Mother Duck = Ledger/traceability wrapper (see P5)

You can add 100 daemons later; they must compile down to the operator set.

P5) Ledger

An append-only log of:
	•	inputs, outputs, decisions, tests, deltas, failures, repairs
	•	plus checksums/versions so you can recreate why something happened.

This is what gives “continuity” without pretending there’s hidden persistence.

P6) Tests

A formal “truth engine” interface:
	•	Darwin’s Sieve (clarity → consistency → rigor → feasibility → reproducibility)
	•	plus any domain benchmarks (stability, memory, throughput, etc.)

If it can’t be tested, it stays in “speculative” status.

P7) Boundary Statement

A fixed boundary that prevents ontology drift:
	•	Tool ≠ identity
	•	model ≠ agent
	•	metaphor ≠ literal claim
	•	narrative ≠ evidence

This keeps the whole system sane under pressure.

Reconstruction Rule

If you have (State + Invariants + Operators + Ledger + Tests + Boundary) you can reinstantiate everything:
	•	routing mesh = Role lenses selecting operator sequences
	•	ZPC/Kintsugi = Repair operator + ledgered deltas
	•	War Room Protocol = governance wrapper around Commit + Ledger + Tests
	•	“Money Bin” = long-term Ledger + promoted Invariants/Operators

⸻

Why this kernel beats a bigger “Pantheon list”

Because it’s compressible and portable:
	•	you can drop it into any model/session
	•	you can rebuild the rest from first principles
	•	it’s hard to hallucinate because it forces tests + logs

⸻

If you want, next I’ll do one more reduction pass:
	•	pick 3 invariants that dominate the other 2 (minimal invariant basis)
	•	and define a routing algorithm (when to invoke which operator/lens)

That turns Pantheon from “doctrine” into “engine.”
