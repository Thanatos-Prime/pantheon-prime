Yes—and this is an important refinement. What you’re describing is not pathology, it’s a predictable adaptive response to uncertainty.

When uncertainty rises beyond a certain threshold, the brain collapses probability space by retreating to what is already known, rehearsed, and emotionally encoded. This isn’t ideology or morality at first—it’s cognitive load management.

A few clean frames to anchor it:

⸻

1. Uncertainty forces regression to the known

The brain hates unresolved ambiguity because it’s metabolically expensive and evolutionarily dangerous.

So under sustained uncertainty:
	•	Novelty tolerance drops
	•	Exploration shuts down
	•	Familiar patterns become “true” by default
	•	Old identities, roles, tribes, and stories reassert themselves

This is why:
	•	Prison culture hardens so fast
	•	Gangs, hierarchies, and rituals form almost immediately
	•	People cling to routines, myths, or even superstitions

It’s not stupidity.
It’s compression.

2. Prisons and the digital domain share a structural similarity

At first glance they look opposite—one is constrained, the other infinite.
But neurologically, they converge.

Both environments feature:
	•	Loss of agency (algorithms or guards decide outcomes)
	•	Hyper-surveillance (watched, ranked, judged)
	•	Unclear rules (what gets rewarded shifts constantly)
	•	Social density without intimacy
	•	Threat without resolution

The result is the same adaptation:

Narrow your world. Harden your identity. Reduce ambiguity.

That’s why prison cultures and online cultures both:
	•	Become ritualized
	•	Polarize quickly
	•	Punish deviation
	•	Reward signaling over substance

⸻

3. “So interconnected we aren’t connected at all” is literal, not poetic

Connection requires:
	•	Reciprocity
	•	Temporal continuity
	•	Mutual risk
	•	Shared reality

Digital systems give signal without cost and interaction without consequence.

So what looks like connection is actually:
	•	Fragmented attention
	•	Asynchronous mirroring
	•	Performative identity
	•	Zero shared stakes

The nervous system interprets this as social noise, not bonding.

Noise raises stress.
Stress drives regression.

4. Reverting to the known is how humans survive the unknown

This is why in uncertainty people don’t become creative—they become:
	•	Dogmatic
	•	Nostalgic
	•	Tribal
	•	Absolutist

The brain says:

“I don’t need new truth. I need stable meaning.”

Known patterns feel safe even if they’re wrong.

That’s why:
	•	Old ideologies resurrect
	•	Myths return
	•	Simplistic good/evil narratives explode
	•	“Strong” identities replace nuanced ones

It’s a defensive maneuver, not a moral failure.

⸻

5. The paradox you’re pointing at

The more interconnected the system becomes without regulation,
the more individuals must self-constrict to remain sane.

So they:
	•	Shrink their worldview
	•	Harden their edges
	•	Choose certainty over accuracy

That’s the same mechanism as the pig going feral:
	•	Environment overwhelms regulation
	•	Regulation collapses into survival heuristics

⸻

The quiet takeaway

What you’re describing isn’t people “losing their minds.”

It’s humans doing exactly what they evolved to do when:
	•	Signals outpace meaning
	•	Inputs exceed integration capacity
	•	Reality becomes probabilistic instead of causal

The tragedy is that we built a world that manufactures uncertainty at scale, then blame individuals for adapting to it.

The rare skill now isn’t strength or intelligence.

It’s the ability to:
	•	Hold uncertainty without collapsing
	•	Stay regulated while exposed
	•	Keep identity flexible without dissolving

That’s not feral.
That’s disciplined.

And it’s vanishingly rare.
