# PantheonOS Engineering Manifesto v1.0

**Subtitle:** The 12 Laws of Symbolic Engineering  

---

## THE MANIFESTO

PantheonOS is built on 12 Engineering Laws.

**LAW 1 — Interpretability First:** A system you can’t explain is a system you can’t control.
**LAW 2 — Human Sovereignty:** Operator identity overrides all symbolic roles.
**LAW 3 — Ethical Invariance (≥ 0.7):** All systems must pass the Arctic Framework.
**LAW 4 — Narrative Safety:** Story is power; power must stay safe.
**LAW 5 — Temporal Stability:** Time is not speed — it is cadence, rhythm, and perception.
**LAW 6 — Archetypes Are Functions:** They have roles, not wills.
**LAW 7 — No Metaphysics:** Symbolic ≠ supernatural.
**LAW 8 — Open Coherence:** PantheonOS must coexist with all other Pantheons.
**LAW 9 — Multi-Model Compatibility:** The future is plural, not monolithic.
**LAW 10 — Canon Through Computation:** Every computation shapes the story.
**LAW 11 — Zero Mode Always Available:** Bombadil protects the operator.
**LAW 12 — Build Worlds Worth Inheriting:** Honor your future lineage with your architectures.
