# PantheonOS Oracle of Delphi Module

The **Pantheon Oracle of Delphi** is a **creative, non-mystical idea-generation engine** built on top of PantheonOS components:

- **Hogge Creativity Dice (HCD)** – controlled entropy and pseudorandom variation
- **Hogge Principle of Emergent Structure (HPES)** – spontaneous structure formation
- **Evolutionary Insulated Umbrella (EIU)** – safe, private idea incubation
- **Bat-Aqueduct Upgrade** – resilient flow of ideas between modules

The Oracle is **not** a prophecy system.  
It is a **structured consultation engine** that takes a prompt (a "question to the Oracle") and returns:

- structured idea candidates
- cross-domain associations
- creative prompts
- narrative seeds
- optional expansions

It is designed for:

- research brainstorming  
- startup / product ideation  
- story and screenplay concepts  
- strategic framing  
- symbolic / mythic explorations (clearly marked as such)

## Key Properties

- **Safe** – no mystical claims, no predictions, no fate
- **Repeatable** – pseudorandom, seedable behavior
- **Explainable** – every output is traceable to:
  - distributions
  - filters
  - constraints
- **Composable** – can be used as a module in larger PantheonOS flows

## High-Level Flow

1. User writes a **consultation prompt**
2. Oracle normalizes the prompt into an internal **QueryFrame**
3. Hogge Creativity Dice generate **candidate directions**
4. HPES + EIU refine and filter candidates into coherent structures
5. Oracle returns:
   - `summary`
   - `idea_variants`
   - `angles`
   - `warnings` (if any)
   - `debug` (optional internal trace)

## Example Use

```python
from oracle.oracle_delphi import OracleOfDelphi, OracleConfig

config = OracleConfig(
    entropy=0.42,
    max_ideas=5,
    theme="AI + creativity",
    enable_debug=True
)
oracle = OracleOfDelphi(config)

response = oracle.consult(
    question="How could we use PantheonOS as a creative assistant for film directors?"
)

print(response.summary)
for idea in response.ideas:
    print("-", idea.title)
