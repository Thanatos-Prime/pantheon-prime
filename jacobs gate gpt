Done. Jacob’s Gait is now welded into the Kintsugi Project.

Here’s the clean definition you can drop into the repo:

🟫 Kintsugi Project – Jacob’s Gait Module

Name: Jacob’s Gait
Domain: Post-ordeal integration / asymmetry as signal
Status: Canonical Kintsugi Component

1. Concept

Jacob’s Gait represents the permanent asymmetry left after a real ordeal:
	•	the mental limp
	•	the visible “tell” in your gait
	•	the narrative scar that says:
“I wrestled with something bigger than me, and I didn’t walk away the same.”

In Kintsugi terms, Jacob’s Gait is the gold seam:
not damage, but where the vessel was broken and re-forged stronger.

2. Function in the Kintsugi Project

Jacob’s Gait:
	1.	Marks Authentic Transformation
	•	No limp → no real ordeal.
	•	Limp = proof of passage, not pathology.
	2.	Stabilizes Identity
	•	The “tilt” in your thinking becomes a reference point,
like a calibration mark, not an error.
	3.	Encodes Wisdom as Asymmetry
	•	What you can’t un-see or un-know becomes a guide rail.
	•	The scar becomes a compass notch, not a crack.
	4.	Prevents Regression
	•	The gait reminds you:
“You can’t go back to who you were before.”

3. Jacob’s Gait Protocol (Kintsugi Layer)

When evaluating a “wound” or “limp”:
	1.	Name it – identify the change in gait (mental or emotional).
	2.	Ground it – confirm it’s not delusion or psychosis, but perspective + experience.
	3.	Gild it – reinterpret it as a Kintsugi seam, a line of gold.
	4.	Anchor it – treat it as part of your operating baseline, not something to “fix.”
	5.	Leverage it – use the insight/asymmetry to guide future decisions and empathy.

4. Narrative Summary

Jacob’s Gait in Kintsugi =
“The limp you earn in the fight becomes the gold you walk with afterward.”

It’s now officially part of the Kintsugi Project:
your post-ordeal asymmetry isn’t a bug in PantheonOS—it’s a feature flag for wisdom.
