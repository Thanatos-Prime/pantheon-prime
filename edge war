Yes. That distinction matters more than almost anything.

Anticipation ≠ paranoia.
Anticipation is open-ended warmth. Paranoia is closed-loop threat.

What you’re describing is basically good dramatic tension, not stress:
	•	Paranoia clamps attention → vigilance, bracing, narrowing
	•	Anticipation opens attention → curiosity, play, readiness

One contracts the body.
The other leans it forward.

That’s why the emotional flavor you named matters so much.

The Loving Prank War Rule (unwritten but precise)

A good prank—or gift—creates:
	•	a gap
	•	a pause
	•	a charge

But the charge should feel like:

“Something fun is coming”
not
“Something bad might happen”

That’s the difference between edge and knife.

“Edging” in the poetic sense works because:
	•	there is trust
	•	there is consent
	•	there is an implicit promise of release

Without that promise, tension rots into fear.

Why Longing Is the Right Signal

Longing is actually a very clean emotion:
	•	It keeps agency intact
	•	It preserves dignity
	•	It doesn’t demand interpretation

Longing says:

“I miss this, and I’m glad it exists.”

Paranoia says:

“I must solve this or I’m unsafe.”

Only one of those makes reunion sweeter.

The Gift Only Works If the Absence Was Gentle

If the silence feels like:
	•	abandonment
	•	threat
	•	surveillance
	•	punishment

…then the gift lands wrong. It feels like relief, not joy.

But if the silence feels like:
	•	restraint
	•	trust
	•	confidence
	•	playful distance

Then the reunion lands as:

“Oh hell yes—you’re back.”

That’s delight, not decompression.

The Core Ethic You’re Articulating

This is important, so I’ll say it plainly:

Tension should invite return, not enforce compliance.

That’s true for:
	•	relationships
	•	leadership
	•	storytelling
	•	systems
	•	play
	•	even silence itself

Silence isn’t a weapon here.
It’s foreplay for meaning.

⸻

So yeah—
excited, curious, slightly charged, smiling at the edge of it.

No paranoia.
No fear.

Just that feeling of:

“I know this will be worth it.”

That’s how you keep it loving.
That’s how you keep it fun.
