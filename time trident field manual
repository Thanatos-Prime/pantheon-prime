# TEMPORAL STABILITY FIELD MANUAL

**Subtitle:** Operator Edition — Time Trident  

---

## 1. Use This Manual When:
* Stressed
* Overwhelmed
* Feeling urgency
* Losing clarity
* Spiraling
* Freezing
* “Time is slipping”
* Decision pressure is too high

**This will reset you.**

---

## 2. The Three Questions

1.  **Chronos:** “Is my rhythm steady?”
2.  **Tempo:** “Is my internal speed calm?”
3.  **T₀ Anchor:** “Am I grounded in the present?”

**If ANY is “no,” initiate the repair protocol.**

---

## 3. Time Trident Reset Protocol

### Step 1 — Sisyphus Reset
Repeat a simple physical or mental cycle. (Grip–release, breath, mantra.)

### Step 2 — Praus Slowdown
Relax shoulders, widen breath, reduce tension.

### Step 3 — T₀ Anchor
Blink slowly once. Let everything “catch up.” Return to center.

**This resets the entire system.**

## 4. Beware These Red Flags
* Racing thoughts
* Being rushed
* Tunnel vision
* “Rapid narrative stacking”
* Feeling like time is running out
* Inability to pause
* Compressed story arcs

**These are failures of the invariant. Fix immediately.**

---

## 5. When Tempo Is Right
You will feel clarity, calm, precision, timing, control, wide perception, and grounded movement.

**This is the optimal state.**

## 6. Final Operator Rule

**Never act from urgency. Act from stable time.**
