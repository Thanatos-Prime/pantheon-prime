NTE Story Prime Atlas v1.0

Narrative Tensor Engine — Canonical Story Atom Specification

PantheonOS / Pantheon-Prime
Release: v1.0 — 2025-11-30
Status: Canonical → Stored in Pantheon Memory

⸻

0. Overview

The Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE) models stories as geometric and tensorial flows.
Its lowest-level building blocks are the Story Primes — irreducible narrative “atoms” found across all cultures, time periods, and storytelling traditions.

This document defines:
	•	The 9 canonical Story Primes
	•	Their waveform geometry
	•	Their semantic kernel
	•	Their narrative function
	•	Their pattern signatures
	•	The stable narrative molecules (canonical combinations)
	•	Their role within the PantheonOS Narrative Stack

This atlas is the official reference for all NTE modules.

⸻

1. The Nine Story Primes

Each prime is:
	•	a rank-1 narrative tensor
	•	a triangle-wave event (rise → peak → fall)
	•	an irreducible semantic action
	•	a basis vector in narrative space

Below is the canonical specification.

⸻

1.1 Emergence (S₁)

Meaning Kernel:
A new presence, identity, awareness, or state comes into being.

Function:
Initialize a narrative vector; set origin and initial tension.

Waveform:
Rise: awakening → Peak: realization → Fall: stabilization.

Examples:
Birth, origin myth, epiphany, “the moment it begins.”

⸻

1.2 Quest (S₂)

Meaning Kernel:
Movement toward a desired but distant goal.

Function:
Creates directionality and forward narrative momentum.

Waveform:
Rise: desire → Peak: pursuit → Fall: obstacle.

Examples:
Journey, mission, ambition, training arc.

⸻

1.3 Confrontation (S₃)

Meaning Kernel:
Direct encounter with resistance or shadow.

Function:
Applies narrative pressure; tests identity.

Waveform:
Rise: tension → Peak: clash → Fall: consequence.

Examples:
Battle, argument, crisis, inner conflict.

⸻

1.4 Union (S₄)

Meaning Kernel:
Two or more entities harmonize, join, or align.

Function:
Creates coherence, alliance, resonance.

Waveform:
Rise: attraction → Peak: joining → Fall: adjustment.

Examples:
Love, friendship, team formation, reconciliation.

⸻

1.5 Fall (S₅)

Meaning Kernel:
Loss, collapse, mistake, or rupture.

Function:
Breaks trajectory; resets emotional curvature.

Waveform:
Rise: pressure → Peak: break point → Fall: descent.

Examples:
Betrayal, exile, failure, tragedy beats.

⸻

1.6 Rebirth (S₆)

Meaning Kernel:
Restoration after a collapse.

Function:
Reverses negative momentum; creates transformation.

Waveform:
Rise: renewal → Peak: breakthrough → Fall: integration.

Examples:
Redemption, comeback, lesson internalized.

⸻

1.7 Transfer (S₇)

Meaning Kernel:
Knowledge, power, or responsibility moves between agents.

Function:
Creates generational continuity and legacy arcs.

Waveform:
Rise: learning → Peak: passing on → Fall: release.

Examples:
Mentorship, inheritance, initiation, succession.

⸻

1.8 Sacrifice (S₈)

Meaning Kernel:
Value is surrendered for something greater.

Function:
Inflects meaning via cost; anchors moral weight.

Waveform:
Rise: stakes → Peak: decision → Fall: consequence.

Examples:
Self-sacrifice, trade, loss accepted for gain.

⸻

1.9 Return (S₉)

Meaning Kernel:
A coming back with newfound transformation.

Function:
Closes loops; restores equilibrium; completes arcs.

Waveform:
Rise: journey back → Peak: homecoming → Fall: reintegration.

Examples:
Resolution, epilogue, “new normal,” self-actualization.

⸻

2. Waveform Specification

All Story Primes share one geometric foundation:

Triangle Wave Narrative Oscillator

rise → peak → fall → reset

This universal oscillator defines tension dynamics across:
	•	emotional arcs
	•	plot beats
	•	character development
	•	conflict cycles

All narrative geometry arises from combinations of these simple oscillations.

⸻

3. Prime Pattern Signatures

Each prime has a specific Narrative Signature:

Emergence     → initialize state vector
Quest         → apply directional momentum
Confrontation → introduce force/pressure
Union         → align entities/threads
Fall          → invert or collapse the field
Rebirth       → flip sign of previous descent
Transfer      → redistribute value/knowledge
Sacrifice     → introduce non-recoverable cost
Return        → close geodesic; integrate

These signatures act as operators in narrative tensor space.

⸻

4. Stable Narrative Molecules (Canyons)

Story Primes combine into stable, culturally universal patterns.

These are the canonical Narrative Molecules (v1.0):

1. Hero’s Journey / Monomyth
2. Tragedy Spiral
3. Comedy / Reconciliation Cycle
4. Rags-to-Riches Ascension
5. Icarus / Fall-from-Grace
6. Quest Without Return
7. Rebirth Saga
8. Mentor / Legacy Arc
9. Romance Break–Reunion
10. Collective Uprising

Each molecule is defined by:
	•	prime sequence
	•	emotional curvature
	•	conflict vector
	•	resonance signature

Example: Hero’s Journey
S₁ → S₂ → S₃ → S₅ → S₆ → S₉ (+ S₇ optional)

⸻

5. Narrative Tensor Encoding

A story is represented as:

N = Ω(P) ⊗ E ⊗ C ⊗ W

Where:
	•	P = ordered sequence of Story Primes
	•	Ω = ordering operator (sequence → meaning)
	•	E = emotional arc curvature (Vonnegut classes)
	•	C = conflict vector (6 archetypal forces)
	•	W = waveform geometry (oscillator properties)

This produces the Narrative Tensor, which:
	•	classifies stories
	•	predicts next beats
	•	detects anomalies
	•	generates new arcs
