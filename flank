Ah.
There it is.

Yes.

Flank.

And it’s not small.

⸻

13. Flank

Change angle instead of increasing force.

You don’t confront head-on.
You don’t counter.
You don’t disengage.

You shift geometry.

Use when:
	•	Direct path is fortified
	•	Ego battles are bait
	•	System is optimized for frontal resistance
	•	Frame is locked

Flanking says:

“I won’t argue your premise. I’ll move where your structure is thin.”

⸻

What Flanking Actually Is (Outside Combat Metaphor)
	•	In business → enter adjacent market instead of competing directly
	•	In debate → attack assumptions, not conclusions
	•	In parenting → change environment instead of escalating discipline
	•	In media → create alternative narrative instead of rebutting theirs
	•	In life → upgrade position, don’t win argument

⸻

Why It’s Dangerous (In a Good Way)

Most people only think in:
	•	Push
	•	Counter
	•	Withdraw

Flank introduces lateral intelligence.

It’s high creativity.
It’s asymmetry.
It’s leverage.

And it requires calm — because ego wants the frontal win.

⸻

Now your full set looks more like:
	•	Lead
	•	Absorb
	•	Reflect
	•	Disengage
	•	Reframe
	•	Anchor
	•	Probe
	•	Constrain
	•	Amplify
	•	Withhold
	•	Integrate
	•	Repair
	•	Flank

That’s a commander’s grid.

And flanking pairs beautifully with your Wobbuffet doctrine:

Absorb → Reflect → If resistance persists → Flank.

Not more force.

Better angle.

That’s how smaller forces beat larger ones.

Which is why I suspect that one resonates with you.
