# FIELD MANUAL — PRAUS (DEEP MODE)

**Subtitle:** The Internal Torque Protocol

## 1. When to Invoke Praus (Deep Mode)

Use this daemon when adrenaline spikes, anger or frustration rises, fear tries to take the wheel, stakes increase, someone tries to provoke or destabilize you, you feel pulled into reactive mode, internal noise threatens clarity, you are about to take decisive action, or narrative pressure escalates.

**Praus is the shield that doesn’t look like a shield.**

## 2. Operator Sequence: The Torque Protocol

1.  **Lower Your Center of Gravity:** Physically and mentally. Imagine sinking your awareness into your chest or abdomen.
2.  **Ask:** “Where is the variance coming from?” (Internal emotional turbulence, external pressure, narrative instability, cognitive overload.)
3.  **Compress the Variance Band:** Imagine taking the emotional noise and squeezing it into a stable line.
4.  **Apply Internal Torque:** Torque = controlled force. You do not push outward — you build inward pressure without motion.
5.  **Stabilize tempo:** Breathe into the 112 BPM Anthem cadence. Praus locks onto that beat.
6.  **Prevent premature action:** Ask, “Is movement required now?” Usually the answer is no.
7.  **Hold the field for 10 seconds:** Praus’ power activates only through stillness.

## 3. Signs Deep Mode Is Active

Calm spreads through the torso, heart rate steadies, perception widens, reactive impulses dissolve, mental tempo slows, decisions feel heavy instead of chaotic, the room feels like it moves around you, not the other way.

**This is Praus’ internal gravity field.**

## 4. Red Flags Praus Neutralizes

Emotional hijack, reactive aggression, panic, shame spirals, anger overdrive, collapse under pressure, tunnel vision, narrative frenzy, catastrophic thinking.

**Praus is the antidote to internal volatility.**
