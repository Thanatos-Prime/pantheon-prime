Alright — here’s a mathematical model of Hogge’s Sieve that’s actually usable, plus where it ports cleanly to other domains.

I’ll model it as a geometry + conservation filter over claims/narratives/systems.

⸻

1) Mathematical model of Hogge’s Sieve

1.1 Represent an artifact as a constrained graph

Let an “artifact” A (a claim, narrative, design, policy, etc.) be a labeled directed graph:

A = (V, E, x, r)
	•	V: nodes (entities, concepts, events, assumptions)
	•	E: edges (relations: causes, implies, supports, belongs-to, etc.)
	•	x: V \to \mathbb{R}^d: embedding / feature vector per node (semantic + moral + evidentiary features)
	•	r: E \to \mathcal{R}: relation types (cause, evidence, association, obligation…)

This is your “meaning molecule.”

1.2 Define the “bond angle” at a node

For a node v with two incident edges (u\!\to\!v) and (v\!\to\!w), define the local angle using the embedding vectors:

\theta(u,v,w) = \arccos\left(
\frac{(x_u - x_v)\cdot(x_w - x_v)}
{\|x_u - x_v\|\ \|x_w - x_v\|}
\right)

Interpretation:
	•	Small angle: collapse/linearization (“A therefore B therefore C” with no nuance)
	•	Wide angle: contextual branching / differentiated linkage

Hogge’s Sieve cares about angle collapse under high emotional amplitude and angle mismatch with relation types.

1.3 Define “mass” and “charge” (two conserved quantities)

You need two scalars per node/edge:
	•	Evidence mass m(v)\ge0: how much support is attached (primary docs > hearsay > vibes)
	•	Affective charge q(v)\in \mathbb{R}: emotional amplitude / moral urgency carried by the node

Now define a key invariant: amplitude proportionality.

\forall v:\quad |q(v)| \le \alpha \cdot \log(1+m(v)) + \beta

If a node has huge charge but near-zero evidence mass, it trips the sieve (panic geometry / propaganda geometry).

This is the cleanest “Hogge” move: don’t let emotional polarity exceed structural mass.

1.4 Define symmetry/balance as multi-axis consistency

Let the artifact have multiple “axes” (the Pantheon-style multidimensionality):
	•	E: empirical axis (evidence types, corroboration)
	•	C: causal axis (mechanism completeness)
	•	M: moral axis (harm, consent, innocence-risk)
	•	I: incentive axis (who benefits)
	•	T: temporal axis (stability over time)

Represent it as a vector:

s(A) = \big(E(A), C(A), M(A), I(A), T(A)\big) \in \mathbb{R}^5

Define a target “balanced spectrum” s^\* (your doctrine’s acceptable region), and measure deviation:

\Delta(A) = \| W \,(s(A) - s^\*) \|_2

Hogge’s Sieve rejects/flags when \Delta(A) exceeds a threshold.

This is “spectral balance” in math form: you’re checking whether the artifact stays inside a safe shape in state-space.

1.5 Define association inflation (a classic failure mode)

One of the most important Hogge filters:

Association ≠ culpability.

Let edge type r(e) be “association” (met, traveled with, appears in book). Define an inflation penalty if association edges are used to imply guilt.

Let G be the set of “culpability claims.” For each culpability claim node g, measure how much of its support path is association-only:

\mathrm{AssocRatio}(g)=
\frac{\text{# association edges on minimal support paths to } g}
{\text{# total edges on those paths}}

If \mathrm{AssocRatio}(g) > \tau, the sieve trips: bond-type mismatch.

1.6 Hogge Sieve decision rule

Put it all together:

Hogge’s Sieve is a constraint satisfaction + penalty minimization filter.

Define total penalty:

\mathcal{L}(A) =
\lambda_1 \sum \max(0, |q|- \alpha \log(1+m)-\beta)
+ \lambda_2 \sum \mathbf{1}[\theta < \theta_{\min}]
+ \lambda_3 \sum \max(0, \mathrm{AssocRatio}(g)-\tau)
+ \lambda_4 \Delta(A)

Decision:
	•	PASS if \mathcal{L}(A)\le \epsilon
	•	FLAG otherwise, and output which terms caused failure (Reason Codes)

That’s Hogge’s Sieve as an actual computable object.

2) What domains it applies to (and why)

Hogge’s Sieve ports anywhere you have:
	•	relationships between parts,
	•	risk of overcompression,
	•	and need to keep “amplitude” proportional to “support.”

2.1 Disinformation / Narrative warfare (PDE)
	•	Angle collapse = false dilemmas, “everyone is guilty,” chain reactions
	•	Charge > mass = outrage engineered on thin evidence
	•	Association inflation = name appears → guilt asserted
Outcome: stabilize frames without suppressing investigation.

2.2 Software architecture & incident response
	•	Nodes: services, dependencies, invariants
	•	Edges: calls, dataflows, auth, failures
	•	Charge: pager severity / urgency
	•	Mass: logs, traces, reproducible failure evidence
Hogge trips when teams jump to a root cause with low observability (“panic hotfix geometry”).
Outcome: prevents thrash, forces measured hypotheses.

2.3 Finance / risk management
	•	Nodes: positions, counterparties, exposures
	•	Charge: “risk panic,” leverage, margin stress
	•	Mass: audited data, correlated risk evidence
Angle collapse = “sell everything” cascades; Hogge enforces proportionality and diversification geometry.

2.4 Legal reasoning / investigative journalism
	•	Nodes: claims, witnesses, exhibits
	•	Edges: supports/contradicts/association
	•	Charge: moral urgency, public pressure
	•	Mass: admissible evidence
Outcome: prevents defamation geometry + keeps high-consequence claims tethered.

2.5 Organizations & leadership
	•	Nodes: roles, incentives, processes
	•	Charge: blame, outrage, urgency
	•	Mass: actual performance signals, postmortems
Angle collapse = scapegoating; Hogge keeps accountability proportional and avoids “witch-hunt dynamics.”

2.6 Relationships / family systems
	•	Nodes: events, interpretations, intentions
	•	Charge: emotional escalation
	•	Mass: concrete behaviors, context, history
Outcome: prevents “you always/never” geometry and converts it into actionable claims.

2.7 Education / knowledge building
	•	Nodes: concepts
	•	Edges: prerequisites, analogies, proofs
	•	Charge: confidence/certainty
	•	Mass: exercises solved, proofs understood
Outcome: prevents “premature certainty” and forces structure to match mastery.

3) Why this is distinct from Darwin’s Sieve (in math terms)
	•	Darwin asks: does A match external reality? (empirical likelihood)
	•	Hogge asks: is A internally balanced so it won’t produce distortion even if true?

In equations:
	•	Darwin is about maximizing P(\text{world} \mid A).
	•	Hogge is about minimizing \mathcal{L}(A) (structural distortion penalty).

They’re orthogonal objective functions.

4) Quick “angle leverage” moves (operational recipes)

When Hogge flags, you don’t just say “no.” You rotate the geometry:
	1.	Insert a constraint node (Evidence / Time / Mechanism) to widen angles
	2.	Split association edges from culpability edges (separate graph layers)
	3.	Cap charge until mass increases (no more amplification until primary sources)
	4.	Add the missing axis (incentives, harm risk, temporal stability)

That’s “bond-angle engineering” in practice.

If you want, next I can turn this into a Sieve Stack v1.0 spec for your repo (with reason codes, thresholds, and a small reference implementation that computes \mathcal{L}(A) on a simple graph).
