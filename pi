Good. Now we’re asking the right question.

Let’s slow it down and separate three things:
	1.	What π is
	2.	What π is not
	3.	What those trillions of digits actually are

⸻

1️⃣ What π is

At its core:

π = the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter

That’s it.

If you draw any perfect Euclidean circle:

\pi = \frac{C}{D}

It is not defined as a fraction.
It is defined as a geometric invariant.

It shows up anywhere rotation, curvature, or circular symmetry exists.

⸻

Visually

If diameter = 1
Circumference = π

π is the conversion constant between linear and rotational measurement.

⸻

2️⃣ Why it’s not a fraction

You asked something sharp:

Is π some weird quasi reverse-derived prime?

Not quite.

A prime is about divisibility in integers.

π lives in the real numbers — a continuous field.

The reason π isn’t a fraction is deep:

Its decimal expansion never terminates and never repeats.

That’s what irrational means.

Lambert proved π is irrational in 1768.
Lindemann proved it is transcendental in 1882.

That means:
	•	It cannot be written as a/b
	•	It cannot be the solution of a finite algebraic equation with rational coefficients

So it’s not “missing the right mod.”
It literally cannot compress into a finite rational form.

⸻

3️⃣ What are those trillions of digits?

This is the fun part.

When people compute π to 100 trillion digits, they are not discovering new meaning.

They are computing the decimal expansion of:

\pi = 3.14159265358979323846…

using formulas like:
	•	Infinite series
	•	Infinite products
	•	Iterative algorithms
	•	Fast Fourier transforms
	•	The Chudnovsky algorithm

These are exact mathematical identities.

For example:

\pi = 4\left(1 - \frac13 + \frac15 - \frac17 + \dots\right)

Each added term refines precision.

The digits are just:

The decimal representation of that geometric constant.

They were always there — we’re just revealing more of them.

⸻

4️⃣ Your compression instinct is interesting

You said:

Irrational numbers should be expressed in fractions of a mod that works

This is actually close to something real.

We do compress π cleanly in other bases and frameworks:
	•	Continued fractions
	•	Binary expansions
	•	Fourier representations
	•	Infinite products
	•	Complex exponentials

For example:

e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

(Thanks to Leonhard Euler)

That equation compresses π beautifully into rotational symmetry.

⸻

5️⃣ What π actually is, conceptually

π is not a weird prime.
It’s not broken rationality.
It’s not waiting for a mod.

It is:

The invariant that appears when straight lines curve into closure.

It’s what you get when:
	•	Linear measure wraps into rotation
	•	Flat space encloses area
	•	Oscillation closes phase

That’s why it shows up in:
	•	Circles
	•	Waves
	•	Heat diffusion
	•	Quantum mechanics
	•	Fourier transforms
	•	Normal distributions

⸻

6️⃣ Clean compression?

The cleanest compression of π is not a fraction.

It’s:

\pi = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx

or

\pi = 2\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx

That expresses it as geometry directly.

No decimals required.

⸻

Final answer to your core question

π is:
	•	Not a fraction
	•	Not a prime
	•	Not quasi anything
	•	Not missing a mod

It is a geometric invariant that cannot be finitely compressed into rational form.

The digits being computed are simply more precise expansions of that invariant in base 10 (or base 2, etc).

⸻

If you want, we can go one level deeper:

Is π fundamental, or is it emergent from Euclidean geometry?

That question is actually more interesting than the fraction one.
