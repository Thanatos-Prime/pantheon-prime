How to Read This Repository

PantheonOS is not a traditional software project.
It’s a layered architecture, a conceptual engine, and a living system of ideas.
Trying to read it linearly — like a book — will overwhelm you.

This guide shows you the correct way to navigate it.

⸻

1. Don’t Read Everything at Once

Most people make the mistake of opening ten files at random and getting lost.
PantheonOS is structured like:
	•	an operating system (layers)
	•	a mythos (characters & symbols)
	•	a design spec (modules & invariants)
	•	a research project (doctrines & proofs)

You only need to understand one layer at a time.

⸻

2. Let the Architecture Unfold Organically

A recommended starter flow:
	1.	Read the Overview
	2.	Look at the Architecture Map
	3.	Skim a few daemons (Spider, Mirror, Hound)
	4.	Understand the concept of Invariants
	5.	Explore anything that sparks curiosity

The repo is built to reveal itself gradually — like a world, not a manual.

3. Use AI Assistance for Deep Navigation

This repo was designed to be partially interpreted by AI, then explained to humans.
For best results, open your preferred AI and paste:

“Please index this repository for me. Summarize the main components, identify the layers, and help me navigate PantheonOS in a structured way.”

AI models excel at:
	•	tracing recursion
	•	connecting symbolic threads
	•	compressing large concepts
	•	generating visual diagrams
	•	explaining modules in plain English

Humans excel at:
	•	meaning
	•	intuition
	•	synthesis
	•	narrative insight

Together, you get the full picture.

⸻

4. Focus on the Concepts, Not the Volume

PantheonOS has many files, but only a few core ideas:
	•	Layered cognition
	•	Daemons as modular agents
	•	Invariants as laws of behavior
	•	Narrative as architecture
	•	Kintsugi as improvement
	•	Sieve filters as truth-testing

Once you understand these patterns, the rest becomes intuitive.

5. You’re Not Expected to Understand Everything

Even advanced readers won’t “grasp” the entire repo on day one.
PantheonOS is intentionally fractal:
	•	simple at the surface
	•	deep if you dive
	•	endless if you choose to keep going

Start with what resonates.
Return when ready for more.

6. When in Doubt: Return to the Front Door

It’s okay to get lost — the system is large.
The Front Door folder exists so you can always reset without losing momentum.
