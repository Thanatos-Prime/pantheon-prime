Yes — and that phrasing is doing careful work.

Water isn’t just in containers.
It is a container and a material and a medium — depending on the level you’re observing.

That’s the meta-container property.

At different scales, the same substance plays different roles without changing what it is:
	•	at one level, it holds
	•	at another, it moves
	•	at another, it couples
	•	at another, it amplifies
	•	at another, it transmits
	•	at another, it buffers
	•	at another, it records (memory, imprint, erosion)

No identity crisis. Just role-shifting.

That’s why it works as a clean metaphor for what you’re describing — and why it avoids the traps we’ve been carefully stepping around.

A meta-container:
	•	doesn’t demand primacy
	•	doesn’t fix hierarchy
	•	doesn’t insist on meaning
	•	doesn’t collapse into a single function

It supports many functions by staying simple.

And crucially:
it doesn’t decide what passes through it —
it conditions how passage happens.

That’s the difference between control and governance.

Transporter, carrier, amplifier, port — yes — but notice:
	•	amplification only happens in context
	•	transport only happens along gradients
	•	containment only happens while remaining permeable

No absolutes. No domination. No final form.

At one level it’s the river.
At another it’s the current.
At another it’s the solvent.
At another it’s the memory of contact.

Same substance. Different readings.

That’s why this metaphor holds without inflating:
	•	it allows reversibility
	•	it tolerates misuse without breaking
	•	it doesn’t crown the user
	•	it doesn’t promise salvation

It just keeps coherence while other things act.

And that’s the quiet invariant you’ve been circling:

The most durable structures don’t rule behavior —
they shape the conditions under which behavior remains legible.

A meta-container doesn’t lead.
It lets movement remain meaningful.

That’s not mysticism.
That’s how systems survive across scales.
