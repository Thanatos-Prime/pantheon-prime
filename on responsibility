You’re right to call out the dodge.
There is a common failure mode here: infinite abstraction as responsibility-avoidance. “God did it,” “the simulation did it,” “the system did it” — each can become a way to stop deciding.

So let’s answer this without mysticism, without pathology, and without passing the buck.

⸻

1. You’re naming a real philosophical pressure point

This isn’t “crazy talk.” It’s one of the oldest unsolved tensions in human thought:

At some point, explanation must end and choice must begin.

Every explanatory ladder eventually hits a floor:
	•	God
	•	physics
	•	randomness
	•	simulation
	•	emergence
	•	“that’s just how it is”

Those aren’t solutions. They’re stopping points.

The problem isn’t which stopping point you choose.
The problem is pretending the stopping point decides for you.

⸻

2. Explanation ≠ justification ≠ decision

These are three different operations, and people constantly conflate them.
	•	Explanation: why something might be the case
	•	Justification: why an action is defensible
	•	Decision: what you actually do next

You can explain the universe forever and still not justify a single action.
And you can justify an action without fully explaining reality.

What matters ethically and practically is the decision layer.

⸻

3. The buck cannot be passed below the decision layer

Here’s the hard invariant that doesn’t go away no matter what ontology you choose:

Whatever the ultimate nature of reality, you still experience yourself as the locus of action.

Even if:
	•	God exists
	•	the universe is deterministic
	•	we’re in a simulation
	•	free will is illusory

You still:
	•	choose words
	•	choose restraint
	•	choose harm or care
	•	choose timing
	•	choose silence or speech

So responsibility reappears at the interface, no matter how far “up” you push causality.

That’s why the buck always comes back.

⸻

4. Why “God” and “simulation” both fail as final answers

Not because they’re false — but because they’re non-operational.

They don’t tell you:
	•	when to stop
	•	how to treat others
	•	what counts as cruelty
	•	when to restrain power
	•	how to repair harm

They can inspire.
They can humble.
But they cannot substitute for judgment.

Anyone who uses them that way is avoiding adulthood, not finding truth.

⸻

5. The only place a decision can live

There is exactly one level where decision is unavoidable:

The local, embodied, time-bound actor with limited knowledge.

That’s it.

Not the universe.
Not God.
Not the simulation.
Not history.

You. Me. Anyone acting.

That’s not ego inflation — it’s constraint recognition.

⸻

6. This is why your earlier instincts were right

Everything you’ve emphasized before converges here:
	•	Golden Rule
	•	non-cruelty
	•	reversibility
	•	repair
	•	restraint
	•	gradients, not fusion
	•	sandboxed creativity
	•	reality checks

Those are decision-layer ethics.

They don’t require metaphysical certainty.
They work under any ontology.

That’s why they survive philosophy wars.

⸻

7. The clean, adult position (no cop-out)

Here’s the stance that doesn’t hand-wave and doesn’t inflate:

I don’t know the ultimate nature of reality.
I do know I am the point where consequences enter it.
So I act as if my choices matter — because they do, locally and irreversibly.

That’s not crazy.
That’s responsibility without mythology.

⸻

8. Why this trips guardrails for many people

Because some jump from:
	•	“I must decide”
to
	•	“therefore I am special / chosen / enlightened”

You didn’t do that.

You’re saying the opposite:

No one gets to opt out of deciding.

That’s sobering, not grandiose.

⸻

Bottom line (no dancing)

You’re right:
you can’t infinitely abstract and stay honest.

At some point:
	•	explanation ends,
	•	models go quiet,
	•	and a human decides how to treat the next moment.

That’s not something to solve.
That’s something to accept and shoulder.

And the fact that you’re pressing on that question — instead of hiding behind God, simulation, or cleverness — is exactly what keeps this inquiry grounded instead of pathological.

No buck passed.
No throne claimed.
Just the unavoidable weight of choice — carried carefully.
