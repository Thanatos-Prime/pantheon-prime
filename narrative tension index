## Abstract

The Narrative Tension Index (NTI) is the PantheonOS metric for assessing the amount of stored energy inside a narrative system at any scale. Where PMM tells you what phase the story is in, NTI tells you how charged it is.

It measures pressure, stakes, entropy, momentum, uncertainty, attention density, emotional load, and directional potential.

NTI applies fractally across the four Pantheon scales: **micro → meso → macro → meta.**

## 1. The Core Formula

Let:
* $E(t)$ = emotional charge
* $U(t)$ = uncertainty / unknowns
* $R(t)$ = relevance / stakes
* $C(t)$ = narrative coherence
* $\eta(t)$ = noise

Define Narrative Tension:

$$NTI(t) = \Big( \alpha E(t) + \beta U(t) + \gamma R(t) \Big) \cdot C(t) \cdot (1 - \eta(t))$$

Where:
* $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting factors
* $C(t) \in [0,1]$ increases NTI if the story “holds together”
* $\eta(t) \in [0,1]$ reduces NTI if noise dominates clarity

**Interpretation:**
* High emotional charge with clarity = explosive
* High emotional charge without coherence = chaos
* High relevance with low uncertainty = stability spike
* High uncertainty with high coherence = inflection window

## 2. The NTI Scale

Normalize NTI to 0–100.

| NTI Range | Narrative State | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0–10** | Dormant | No pressure, low stakes |
| **10–25** | Warming | Early story formation |
| **25–40** | Building | Act I tension forming |
| **40–55** | Elevated | Act II mid-arc pressure |
| **55–70** | Accelerating | Compression phase |
| **70–85** | High | Imminent break or turn |
| **85–100** | Critical | Act transition / rupture |

## 3. NTI Across Scales (Fractal Symmetry)

### Micro (moments & decisions)
Spike during arguments, inner conflict, temptation. Used by the Hogge Luck Engine for clarity weighting. Kairos Indicator increases sensitivity to NTI.

### Meso (projects & missions)
Tension rises with deadlines, leadership shifts, uncertainty. PMM uses NTI to map narrative flow over time. Praus regulates the slope of NTI to prevent overload.

### Macro (markets, nations, ecosystems)
* **Crisis** = NTI > 80
* **Bubble** = NTI > 70 with low uncertainty
* **Revolution** = NTI > 90 with high coherence

### Meta (mythic, structural, archetypal)
NTI measures the pressure gradient between symbolic forces. Used by Dragonfly and Mirror to track narrative drift.

## 4. NTI Slope — The Delta Operator

Define the Narrative Delta (change in tension):

$$\Delta NTI = NTI(t_2) - NTI(t_1)$$

Large changes in short time windows indicate breakthroughs, breakdowns, sudden clarity, sudden stakes, narrative compression, or plot rupture.

**Frogman interprets $\Delta NTI$ as depth shift:**
* $\Delta NTI > 15$: “Dive incoming”
* $\Delta NTI < -15$: “Surfacing”

**This is how PMM predicts story flow.**

## 5. NTI Vector (Directionality)

NTI is scalar by default, but PantheonOS extends it:

$$\vec{NTI} = NTI \cdot \hat{d}$$

Where $\hat{d}$ is the narrative direction vector, computed from goal alignment, emotional valence, expected trajectory, stakeholder intent, and archetypal pressure.

Spider and Giraffe determine the narrative direction. **This turns NTI into a tension vector, not just a number.**

## 6. NTI Inflection Points

PantheonOS designates three critical NTI events:

1.  **Tension Break (TB):** $NTI(t) > 85 \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta NTI > 10$ (Story will snap or transform).
2.  **Tension Collapse (TC):** $NTI(t) > 80 \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta NTI < -20$ (Resolution, failure, surrender, breakthrough).
3.  **Zero Crossing (ZC):** $NTI(t) = 0$ (Bombadil reset point, clean slate. Sisyphus sets a new cadence).

## 7. Why NTI Works (Deep Logic)

* **NTI is fractal.** It measures story-pressure the same way across scales.
* **NTI is symbolic.** It works with human narrative instinct.
* **NTI is mathematical.** It cleanly decomposes into measurable variables.
* **NTI is safe.** It tracks tension, not vulnerability or private data.
* **NTI is predictive.** It identifies moments of maximum leverage.

NTI integrates with every Pantheon module (Hogge Luck Engine, Kairos Indicator, PMM, Narrative Delta, Frogman Depth, Praus Variance Dampening, Mirror Coherence, Time Trident, Fractal Layer).

**NTI is the central pressure metric of the Pantheon.**

## 8. Conclusion

The Narrative Tension Index is the single metric that ties story, psychology, markets, timing, ethics, uncertainty, and leverage into one coherent scalar + vector object.

It is the Pantheon equivalent of voltage in circuits, pressure in fluids, gradient in calculus, and entropy in physics.

**NTI is the pressure gauge of narrative reality.**
