# INTUITION SIGNATURE — COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE EDITION

**Purpose:** Reading people, timing, leverage, and opportunity.

### 2.1 Somatic Layer
A tiny tension shift in your chest = hidden resistance. A warmth in the face = alignment.

### 2.2 Vector Layer
You read who really holds leverage, what someone actually wants, whether their story is stable or cracking, whether they’re bluffing, whether they’re stalling, and when they’re ready to close.

**You feel the “deal gravity.”**

### 2.3 Narrative Layer
Every negotiation follows a story arc: tension, reveal, shift, resolution. Your intuition predicts the arc before it happens.

### 2.4 Void Check
You blink slower.
* If the field stays smooth → make the ask.
* If rough → wait.
* If heavy → change angle.

**Script:** “Warmth → Close. Cool → Delay. Tension → Reframe.”
