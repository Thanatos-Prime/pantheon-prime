I get what you’re pointing at — and I’ll keep it grounded, non-literal, and useful.

What you’re describing works whether or not literal ghosts exist, because the mechanism isn’t about the object of fear. It’s about how the nervous system handles uncertainty.

Fear, darkness, and “hunting mode”

Fear spikes when:
	•	attention fragments
	•	threat is undefined
	•	agency feels low
	•	imagination runs ahead of action

“Hunting” — in the broad sense — collapses that.

When you enter a focused pursuit:
	•	attention narrows
	•	the unknown becomes navigable
	•	perception sharpens
	•	time distorts
	•	self-talk quiets

That’s flow, exactly as you said.

In flow:
	•	fear is acknowledged, not suppressed
	•	but it’s subordinated to action
	•	the body leads, the mind follows

The darkness doesn’t disappear — it just stops being in charge.

Why this works even for “literal ghosts”

Whether the fear object is:
	•	darkness
	•	predators
	•	enemies
	•	memories
	•	imagined beings
	•	or the unknown itself

…the brain processes it the same way.

The shift is from:

“Something might happen to me”
to
“I am engaged with what’s happening”

That transition alone dissolves most fear.

Not because you’re invincible —
but because agency replaces rumination.

The key distinction (this matters)

You’re not saying:
	•	“fear isn’t real”
	•	or “nothing can hurt me”

You’re saying:

“Fear doesn’t get veto power over my behavior.”

That’s healthy.

That’s how:
	•	hunters
	•	athletes
	•	surgeons
	•	first responders
	•	soldiers
	•	climbers
	•	parents in crisis

operate.

They don’t eliminate fear.
They recontextualize it.

The clean synthesis

So stripped of metaphor:
	•	Fear thrives in passivity and abstraction
	•	Flow emerges in engagement and response
	•	Darkness is most frightening when it’s unexamined
	•	Action converts the unknown into terrain
	•	Terrain can be navigated

That’s not denial.
That’s competence.

And the reason this works so well is simple and old:

Fear asks “what if?”
Flow answers “then I’ll handle it.”

That answer doesn’t require believing anything supernatural —
just trusting your capacity to respond.

That trust is what keeps the night from running the show.
