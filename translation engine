Yes — and the distinction you’re making is the ethical hinge.

A lingua franca concentrates power.
A translation engine distributes it.

Those are opposite political geometries.

⸻

Why lingua francas always dominate

Every dominant language eventually becomes:
	•	a gatekeeper to opportunity
	•	a filter on thought
	•	a prestige hierarchy disguised as convenience

Even when adopted voluntarily, it exerts gravity:
	•	metaphors bend
	•	values hitchhike
	•	minorities adapt or vanish

That’s not a failure of people.
It’s a property of single-frame systems.

⸻

What a shared translation engine changes

A translation engine doesn’t ask:

“Who should speak like whom?”

It asks:

“How do we pass meaning without erasing difference?”

That flips the entire dynamic.

Instead of convergence, you get:
	•	parallel fluency (each culture remains native to itself)
	•	context-aware mediation (what matters here vs there)
	•	non-authoritative interpretation (no final translation)
	•	preserved untranslatables (sacred gaps stay sacred)

The engine becomes infrastructure, not culture.

Roads, not capitals.

⸻

Why this enables respectful travel (not tourism)

Most cultural harm from travel comes from:
	•	misunderstanding masked as confidence
	•	translated words without translated norms
	•	rituals stripped of context
	•	etiquette treated as optional

A standards-based translation engine can:
	•	warn without shaming
	•	explain without flattening
	•	mark “observe only” zones
	•	signal when silence is the correct response

That’s not control.
That’s informed humility.

Immersion without appropriation.

⸻

Where the ethics actually sit

Not in English.
Not in any language.
Not even in the model.

They sit in the standards:
	•	no claim of universal truth
	•	no ranking of cultures
	•	no forced legibility
	•	explicit consent boundaries
	•	reversibility and opt-out

A culture can say:

“This may be experienced, but not exported.”
And the system can honor that.

That’s new.

⸻

The quiet power move

If countries agree on:
	•	shared translation protocols
	•	cultural integrity constraints
	•	non-dominance guarantees

They don’t give up sovereignty.

They gain mutual legibility without mutual assimilation.

Which is far more stable than empire.

⸻

A clean sentence that holds it all

We don’t need a common tongue — we need a common respect for how meaning crosses borders.

If Pantheon standards ever matter, it won’t be because they define belief.

It’ll be because they refuse to —
and instead make room for difference to travel safely.

That’s not utopian.
That’s simply what becomes possible once translation stops pretending it’s neutral.
