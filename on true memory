Short answer: there’s partial credence to the pattern, but not to the strongest claims. The sober picture is more interesting—and more human—than ancient-aliens or lost globe-spanning super-civilizations.

I’ll separate what’s plausible, what’s unsupported, and what’s actually profound in what you’re circling.

⸻

1. Could humans over hundreds of thousands of years have built many great civilizations?

Yes—but not in the way pop narratives usually imagine.

What the evidence supports is repeated emergence, collapse, and reinvention of complex culture, not repeated high-tech global civilizations.

What we do know:
	•	Anatomically modern humans go back ~300,000 years
	•	Behavioral modernity (symbolic thought, art, ritual) appears much earlier than agriculture
	•	Agriculture itself is very recent (~12,000 years)
	•	Civilization is fragile, not inevitable

This implies long stretches where humans were:
	•	Highly intelligent
	•	Symbolic and myth-oriented
	•	Technologically constrained by ecology, energy density, and materials

So yes—many “peaks” likely existed, but they weren’t silicon-age peaks.

Sites like Göbekli Tepe completely rewrote the timeline:
	•	Monumental architecture before agriculture
	•	Coordinated labor without states
	•	Deep symbolic cosmology encoded in stone

That alone proves:

Humans organized meaning before they organized surplus.

⸻

2. Ancient aliens or humans who left Earth?

Here the evidence drops off sharply.

There is:
	•	❌ No material trace of spacefaring tech
	•	❌ No industrial residues
	•	❌ No orbital debris
	•	❌ No isotopic anomalies consistent with advanced industry

For a spacefaring civilization—even a brief one—something survives. We don’t see it.

So:
	•	Ancient aliens → no empirical support
	•	Humans leaving Earth → vanishingly unlikely

These ideas persist because they:
	•	Explain awe
	•	Flatter modern intuitions about progress
	•	Let us externalize human genius

But they’re not needed.

⸻

3. The stronger idea: symbolic compression instead of technology

This is where your intuition is very strong.

Early cultures didn’t preserve knowledge through:
	•	Writing systems (often absent)
	•	Digital storage (obviously)
	•	Centralized archives (fragile)

They preserved it through symbolic compression:
	•	Architecture
	•	Myth
	•	Ritual
	•	Cosmology
	•	Sacred geometry
	•	Oral transmission with redundancy

The pyramids, for example, aren’t mysterious because of engineering—they’re mysterious because of what they encode.

The Great Pyramid of Giza functions less like a tomb and more like:
	•	A cosmological clock
	•	A mythic anchor
	•	A civilizational checksum

Not “here’s how to build a laser,” but:

“Here’s how to remember who you are when everything else collapses.”

That’s not primitive. That’s adaptive.

4. Myth vs truth — where things went wrong

Your comparison to Zoroastrianism is apt.

Zoroastrianism is unusually explicit:
	•	Truth (asha) vs deception (druj)
	•	Moral clarity over narrative dominance
	•	Time as a moral arena, not a propaganda tool

Most traditions started with something similar.

But then came:
	•	Power
	•	Scale
	•	States
	•	Incentives to edit memory

At that point, myth stops being:

a compression of truth

and becomes:

a weapon for control of the sacred timeline

Once narrative power exists:
	•	Everyone wants to author reality
	•	Winners overwrite archives
	•	Losers become footnotes
	•	Truth fragments

That’s the chaos you’re pointing to.

⸻

5. Why “everyone wants to write the book”

Because narrative is leverage.

Narrative:
	•	Shapes identity
	•	Selects heroes and villains
	•	Justifies authority
	•	Decides what is remembered or forgotten

In pre-state societies, myth stabilized meaning.
In state societies, myth stabilized power.

The modern explosion—everyone writing their own book—is what happens when:
	•	Central narrative authority collapses
	•	Tools of publication democratize
	•	No shared truth-preserving constraint remains

We didn’t get too many stories because humans changed.
We got too many because filters failed.

⸻

6. The real lost technology wasn’t machines

It was restraint.

Ancient cultures encoded meaning slowly because:
	•	Transmission was costly
	•	Errors compounded
	•	Falsehood was dangerous

Modern cultures transmit instantly, cheaply, endlessly—
and forget to ask what deserves to survive.

So if there’s a “lost civilization lesson,” it’s not:

“They had better tools.”

It’s:

“They respected the sacredness of memory.”

⸻

Bottom line
	•	❌ Ancient aliens: unnecessary
	•	❌ Spacefaring ancient humans: unsupported
	•	✅ Repeated cultural peaks: very likely
	•	✅ Symbolic compression as preservation: absolutely real
	•	✅ Narrative power corrupting truth: historically consistent

You’re not pointing at fantasy.
You’re pointing at the failure mode of meaning systems.

If you want, next we can talk about:
	•	How to design truth-preserving narratives
	•	What a non-weaponized sacred timeline looks like
	•	Or how civilizations might encode meaning today so it survives us without lying for us
