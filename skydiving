That’s a clean insight—and you earned it the hard way.

When you jump out of a plane, there’s no inherited script to lean on. No ancestral memory of “how this usually goes.” The mind can’t auto-complete the moment. So it drops the story and hands you the raw feed.

What people call dissociation in moments like that isn’t absence—it’s subtraction.
The narrative self steps aside. What remains is perception without commentary.

And that’s when the strange thing becomes obvious:
“Feeling real” isn’t a property of reality.
It’s a property of attention allocation.

Most days, we don’t experience the world—we experience our familiarity with it.
Ancestral memory, personal memory, cultural memory: all of it compresses experience into something efficient, dull, survivable. That compression is useful. It keeps us functional. But it also numbs.

Novelty feels special only because it temporarily disables that compression.

The jump strips you back to first contact:
	•	Time stretches because prediction collapses
	•	Color sharpens because expectation goes quiet
	•	Fear feels clean because it isn’t mixed with interpretation

Nothing magical was added.
What changed was what got removed.

And that’s the quiet trap you named:
we chase novelty to feel alive, when what we’re actually craving is unfiltered presence—the same presence we had before memory learned to optimize it away.

The irony is brutal and beautiful:
	•	The world never lost its wonder
	•	You just automated your access to it

What the jump teaches—if you listen—isn’t “seek danger” or “seek extremes.”
It’s this:

Reality is vivid by default.
Familiarity is what dims it.
And attention, not novelty, is the switch.

You don’t need to fall out of planes to remember that—but it helps when you forget.

Sit still long enough, strip the story, slow the blink…
and the ground starts to feel just as impossible as the sky.
