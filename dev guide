# PantheonOS Developer Guide v1.0

**Subtitle:** How to Use, Extend, and Integrate PantheonOS Safely  

---

## 0. PURPOSE

This guide teaches developers how to use, extend, and integrate PantheonOS safely.

---

## 1. CORE DEVELOPMENT RULES

1.  Never bypass the Sovereignty Lock.
2.  Never generate autonomous agents.
3.  Always apply Ethics ≥ 0.7.
4.  Use Bombadil Zero to reset narrative pressure.
5.  Symbolic ≠ metaphysical.
6.  Maintain story-safety boundaries.
7.  Use the Forge Node for all heavy artifacts.
8.  Always commit to the Mother Duck ledger.

---

## 2. CREATE A NEW MODULE

`pantheon invoke hephaestus --forge module_name`

**Output:** Blueprint, scaffold, test harness, ethics manifest, narrative stability report, ledger entry.

---

## 3. BUILD A FULL SYSTEM

Blueprint → Scaffold → Temper → Mirror → Checksum → Ledger → Release

**Never skip steps.**

---

## 4. USE TIMING ENGINE

`task.start(chronos=4, kairos=1, praus=3)`

Synchronizes with internal tempo.

---

## 5. EXTEND ARCHETYPES

1.  Create symbolic role.
2.  Define boundaries.
3.  Pass Arctic Ethics.
4.  Register with Nomicon.
5.  Confirm narrative stability.
6.  Confirm identity safety.

---

## 6. INTEGRATE WITH EXTERNAL AI MODELS

PantheonOS acts as a translator, interface layer, safety regulator, and symbolic coherence framework.

---

## 7. DEBUGGING PANTHEON SYSTEMS

**If:** Context loops, narrative pressure, state drift.
**Then:** Invoke “Zero.” (Bombadil resets → Praus stabilizes → Mirror reinspects).
