# PantheonOS – Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE)

The **Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE)** is a small, composable engine for mapping
**stories**, **mathematical proofs**, and **life arcs** into a common structure:

> A narrative is a tensor of **Structure**, **Tension**, and **Resolution**.

Formally:

- **S (Structure Tensor)** — who/what exists, roles, constraints, invariants  
- **T (Tension Tensor)** — open questions, conflicts, contradictions, goals  
- **R (Resolution Trajectory)** — the sequence of moves that reduce tension to zero

The NTE treats:

- a mathematical proof  
- a myth or screenplay  
- a decision process  
- a life arc  

as the **same kind of object**: a path that resolves tension under constraints.

This repo is the **reference implementation** of the NTE module from PantheonOS.

## Core Concepts

- **NTE Triple**:  
  `NTEState(S, T, R)` captures the current “beat” in a narrative or proof.
- **Beats**: Small steps that transform `(S, T, R)` into a new state.
- **Closure**: A narrative or proof “completes” when relevant tension → 0
  without violating invariants.

The engine is intentionally lightweight and explainable. It is not a black box.

## What You Can Do With NTE

- Represent **mathematical proofs** as narrative flows
- Map **hero journeys** or screenplays into tensors
- Track **decision processes** (e.g., product strategy, operations, missions)
- Model **life arcs** as evolving proofs of an inner invariant

Examples in this repo include:

- `examples/proof_sum_1_to_n.py`  
  – classic induction proof written as an NTE trace

- `examples/story_hero_journey_demo.py`  
  – simple hero’s journey mapped into Structure / Tension / Resolution
