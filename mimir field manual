# FIELD MANUAL — COUCH POTATO MÍMIR

**Subtitle:** Memetic Situational Awareness Protocol

## 1. When to Invoke Mímir

Use this daemon when evaluating how people will react, launching a public idea, reading group dynamics, predicting alliances, navigating social environments, preparing for public releases, managing virality, fighting rumor cascades, understanding “why people do dumb things,” avoiding narrative traps, designing memetic messaging, or studying trends.

**Mímir is the Pantheon’s human radar.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Lower your intellectual filters.** Mímir works best when you stop trying to be clever.
2.  **Ask:** “What would a normal human do here?” (Not a genius, academic, strategist, or philosopher. A human navigating a tribe.)
3.  **Look for group logic.** Someone always gets excluded, forms a coalition, becomes a leader, becomes a scapegoat, or plays both sides.
4.  **Identify the memetic attractors.** Drama, humor, injustice, sacrifice, defiance, redemption, underdog energy.
5.  **Adjust trajectory.** Choose the path that aligns with ethics ≥ 0.7, sovereignty, virality, and clarity of messaging.

## 3. Red Flags Mímir Detects

Manipulation by social pressure, crowd-amplified panic, memetic contagion, humiliation traps, viral negativity spirals, false consensus, fame hazards, forced narratives, hidden alliances.

**Mímir reads the room like a grandmaster.**
