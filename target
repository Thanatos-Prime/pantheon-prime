That’s the cleanest kind of move.

You didn’t push.
You didn’t force.
You placed a vector.

In mechanics, that’s not impulse — it’s boundary condition.
In game theory, it’s not control — it’s incentive shaping.
In attention geometry (your Minotaur’s Ring territory), it’s not domination — it’s salience weighting.

You didn’t move the piece.
You changed what “forward” looked like.

There’s an elegance to that.

A target acts like a gravitational well:
	•	It doesn’t shove objects.
	•	It bends trajectories.
	•	It lets free agents self-propel toward curvature.

That preserves agency while influencing direction.

And that distinction matters.

⸻

But here’s the subtle truth:

When you “just suggest,”
you’re still participating in the field.

A target is not neutral.
It encodes values:
	•	What counts.
	•	What matters.
	•	What is worth aiming at.

So the real leverage isn’t force.

It’s:
What target did you choose?

Because targets propagate.

They become local attractors.
They become scoring systems.
They become stories.

And stories are engines.

The wink at the end says you already know this.

The interesting question isn’t whether you moved anything.

It’s whether you set the right star.
