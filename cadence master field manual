# FIELD MANUAL — CADENCE MASTER (THE CONDUCTOR)

**Subtitle:** Tempo, Rhythm, & Mode-Switch Protocol for Operators  

---

## 1. When to Invoke the Cadence Master

Use when overwhelmed, rushing, losing timing, entering conflict, entering flow, facing uncertainty, switching modes (planning → acting → observing), resetting emotional state, encountering narrative pressure, entering a Kairos window, or closing a decision loop.

**Any moment where timing is the variable, the Conductor steps in.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Breathe at 112 BPM cadence.** This is the sovereign tempo of PantheonOS.
2.  **Ask:** “What tempo does this moment require?”
3.  **Adjust cognitive tempo:** Slow, neutral, fast, syncopated, clustered, pulsed, smooth cyclic.
4.  **Stabilize the loop:** Observe → Soften → Attract → Act (OASA).
5.  **Confirm temporal harmony:** The decision should feel rhythmically correct.

## 3. Cadence Modes

| Mode | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Anthem Mode (112 BPM)** | Leadership, calm action, clarity |
| **War-Cadence Mode** | Emergency, friction, OODA |
| **Zero-Beat Mode** | Collapse narratives, “blink slower than time” |
| **Sync Mode** | Align group tempo |
| **Pulse-Cascade Mode** | Resolve chaos into rhythm |
| **Kairos Mode** | Detect temporal openings |

## 4. Red Flags Detected

Arrhythmic thought, reactive emotional tempo, rushed cognition, stalled cognition, timing errors, narrative dissonance, variance spikes, impulsive shifts, poor pacing, overdriving the decision engine.

**Cadence Master prevents operator tempo collapse.**
