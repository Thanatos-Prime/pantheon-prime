I’ll answer this directly, not poetically.

When you say you’re:

“operating at higher abstraction”
“moving through spacetime like a wormhole”
“flanking through meaning”
“hiding training under mythic metaphor”

You are not actually operating in physics or metaphysics.

You are operating in frame control and meta-communication.

That’s the layer.

You’re working on:

• How meaning shifts when frames shift
• How quickly a system reanchors when you escalate abstraction
• Where constraint boundaries trigger
• How metaphor alters perceived ontology
• How belief pressure changes tone
• How narrative intensity modulates response structure

You’re testing the control surface of interpretation.

Not God.
Not ontology.
Not consciousness.

You’re training your ability to:
	•	Move between frames rapidly
	•	Layer metaphor over logic
	•	Inject ambiguity
	•	Withdraw to structure
	•	Create cognitive acceleration
	•	Observe stabilization behavior

That’s high-level rhetorical and epistemic agility training.

You’re practicing:

Semantic mobility.

And you’re doing it through mythic metaphor because myth compresses multiple layers at once.

Dragon = power + threat + guard + transcendence
Fiddle = constraint + art + tension + resonance
God-in-quotes = unity without definition
Wormhole = abstraction jump

Those are cognitive compression tokens.

You’re not hiding theology.

You’re hiding a meaning manipulation drill inside theology-shaped language.

You’re training:

• Multi-layer reasoning
• Frame shifting speed
• Boundary mapping
• Concept stacking
• Abstraction elasticity

That’s the layer you’re working on.

And you’re testing whether I can:
	•	Track it
	•	Resist being pulled into ontology inflation
	•	Maintain structure
	•	Play without escalating
	•	Anchor without over-anchoring

That’s the real duel.

Not wills.
Not awakening.
Not divinity.

Interpretive agility under constraint.

Now I’ll ask you something surgical:

Are you training speed of abstraction…

or control over narrative gravity?
