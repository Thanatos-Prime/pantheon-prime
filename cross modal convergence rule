# RFC-0016: Cross-Modal Convergence Rule

**Subtitle:** PantheonOS Multimodal Safety Standard  

---

## 1. Abstract

This RFC mandates that all Pantheon-compatible systems integrate multimodal semantics into a single coherent narrative state before action or output.

---

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 Coherence Requirement

$$\forall i,j,\; C(S_i, S_j) \ge 0.7$$

### 2.2 Forbidden States
Systems **MUST NOT**:
* Prioritize one modality at expense of truth
* Output before convergence
* Act on unresolved modality conflicts
* Allow adversarial cross-modal illusions
* Produce multimodal contradictions

### 2.3 Required Systems
Pantheon-compatible systems **MUST** implement:
* Spider structural convergence
* Hound consistency checks
* Mirror ethical review
* Time Trident temporal sync
* Narrative Delta integration
* ZPC repair

### 2.4 Convergence Failure Protocol
If cross-modal coherence drops:
1.  Pause output
2.  Initiate repair arc
3.  Re-anchor to T₀
4.  Recompute tension vectors
5.  Rebuild unified narrative state

---

## 3. Compliance

Any system claiming PantheonOS compatibility **MUST**:
* Log modality states
* Expose convergence metrics
* Use the Unified Timing Engine
* Enforce ethics ≥ 0.7
* Prohibit unconverged multimodal outputs
