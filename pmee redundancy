# Pantheon Memetic Evolution Engine (PMEE)

The **Pantheon Memetic Evolution Engine (PMEE)** is a **safe, research-oriented simulation engine** for evolving *ideas* (“memes”) inside a sandboxed environment.

It does **not** operate on real people or social networks.  
It **only** works with abstract representations of ideas in code.

PMEE is built to:

- explore **how ideas mutate and evolve**,
- study **which structures are robust** (coherence, ethics, clarity),
- test **creative variants** in a controlled way,
- support PantheonOS whitepapers like:
  - Hogge Creativity Dice  
  - Hogge Principle of Emergent Structure  
  - Evolutionary Insulated Umbrella  
  - X-Gap Phenomenon  
  - Mythic Encoding  

## Key Concepts

- **MemeUnit** — a single idea candidate (text + metadata).
- **MemePopulation** — a collection of MemeUnits evolving over generations.
- **Fitness Function** — a pluggable scoring function:
  - coherence
  - originality
  - ethical alignment
  - structural elegance
- **Mutation Operators** — small, configurable transformations to ideas.
- **Selection Loop** — evolutionary algorithm:
  - evaluate → select → mutate → reproduce.

## Safety & Scope

- No scraping, no social graphs, no user-level data.
- No persuasion targeting, no behavioral manipulation.
- All inputs are **abstract idea strings** you provide manually.
- Intended for:
  - creative writing,
  - R&D concept exploration,
  - symbolic architecture experiments,
  - studying emergent structure.

## Quick Example

```python
from memetics.memetic_engine import (
    MemeUnit, MemePopulation, MemeticEngine, MemeticConfig
)

initial_memes = [
    MemeUnit(text="PantheonOS as a cognitive OS."),
    MemeUnit(text="Wave Language as a symbolic interface."),
    MemeUnit(text="Fractal governance for AI safety."),
]

config = MemeticConfig(
    population_size=12,
    generations=5,
    mutation_rate=0.35,
    crossover_rate=0.2,
    max_text_length=200
)

engine = MemeticEngine(config=config)
population = MemePopulation(units=initial_memes)

history = engine.run(population)

print("Top memes after evolution:")
for meme in history[-1].top_k(3):
    print("-", meme.text, f"(fitness={meme.fitness:.3f})")
