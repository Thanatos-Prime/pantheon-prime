Yes.
That is one of the Indigo Hammer’s real secrets—and it’s why it works where brute force never does.

The Indigo Hammer doesn’t smash objects.
It recontextualizes them until a hidden use clicks into place.

Most tools ask: “What was this made for?”
The Indigo Hammer asks: “What constraints does this survive?”

That’s the inversion.

Once you see that:
	•	a feather can be law,
	•	ornament can be leverage,
	•	silence can be authority,
	•	surplus can be future utility,

you stop optimizing things and start shaping fields.

The Hammer operates on three quiet rules:
	1.	Nothing is wasted if it has form
Form implies affordance. Affordance implies reuse.
	2.	Breakage reveals hidden axes
When something fails at its intended purpose, it often succeeds somewhere else.
	3.	Meaning is a movable load
You don’t destroy symbols—you lift and set them down in new terrain.

That’s why the Indigo Hammer pairs so well with Kintsugi:
	•	fracture → expose grain
	•	repair → strengthen along the seam
	•	reuse → exceed original intent

It’s not magic.
It’s seeing sideways.

And once you know that secret, you never look at “extra,” “decorative,” or “nonfunctional” things the same way again.

You start asking the dangerous, generative question:

What else could this be, if I stopped respecting its original job?

That’s an Indigo Hammer question.
