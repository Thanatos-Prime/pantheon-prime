**Subject: Combat-Disabled Retirees Need S. 1032 - Request for Floor Time or NDAA Vehicle**

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing as [a veteran / constituent / advocate] to respectfully request your support in advancing S. 1032, the Major Richard Star Act, during this session.

**The Policy Challenge**

Currently, approximately 50,000 combat-disabled military retirees who were medically retired before reaching 20 years of service face an unfair offset: they must forfeit one dollar of earned retirement pay for every dollar of VA disability compensation they receive.

This offset treats two fundamentally different payments as if they were duplicative:

- **Military retirement pay** compensates years of faithful service to the nation
- **VA disability compensation** addresses service-connected injuries and diminished earning capacity

These are distinct obligations from different agencies (DoD vs. VA) addressing different harms. Combat injuries that forced early medical retirement should not nullify earned retirement benefits.

**Strong Bipartisan Support**

S. 1032 currently has over 70 Senate cosponsors and companion legislation H.R. 2102 has over 300 House cosponsors. This is consensus veterans policy with overwhelming support across party lines.

**Addressing Cost Concerns**

I understand fiscal concerns have been raised. The veteran community is open to reasonable implementation mechanics to address scoring:

1. **Phased rollout** by retirement cohort to smooth outlays over time
1. **Neutral offsets** using rescissions of unobligated balances or other mutually acceptable pay-fors
1. **Review provisions** (e.g., 3-year GAO evaluation) to ensure program integrity

We are flexible on implementation timeline—but the core policy principle is non-negotiable. These veterans earned both payments through different sacrifices.

**Three Specific Requests**

1. **Schedule floor time** for S. 1032 for a standalone vote, OR
1. **Include in the NDAA conference** or a veterans legislative package, AND
1. **Convene a staff-level session** within the next two weeks to discuss offset options and CBO score refinements

These wounded warriors have waited long enough. With bipartisan support already secured and a path forward on fiscal mechanics, we can deliver this overdue justice this year.

Thank you for your consideration and your service to our nation. I welcome the opportunity to discuss this further with your legislative staff.

Respectfully,

## Email #2: To Your Senators (Combined Shutdown + Star Act)

**Subject: Urgent: Reopen Government & Advance Major Richard Star Act**

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State] regarding two urgent matters requiring Congressional action: ending the current government shutdown and passing the Major Richard Star Act.

**1. End the Government Shutdown Immediately**

The federal government has now been shut down for 27 days. The impacts are serious and worsening:

- Federal courts are furloughing staff, creating justice delays and case backlogs
- The National Nuclear Security Administration has furloughed 80% of its workforce, affecting nuclear security operations
- Federal workers are facing their second missed paycheck
- [Add local impact if applicable]

**I urge you to support a clean continuing resolution (CR) to reopen the government now.** Policy debates on spending priorities should continue—but with the government operating, not shut down. Courts and national security cannot wait.

**2. Pass the Major Richard Star Act (S. 1032)**

Separately, I ask for your leadership in advancing S. 1032, the Major Richard Star Act, which now has over 70 Senate cosponsors.

The bill addresses a longstanding injustice: combat-disabled military retirees who were medically separated before 20 years of service must currently offset their earned retirement pay dollar-for-dollar against VA disability compensation.

**These are two different payments:**

- Retirement pay = compensation for years of service rendered
- Disability pay = compensation for service-connected injuries

The veteran community is open to phased implementation and fiscal offsets if needed—but the policy must advance. These wounded warriors have broad bipartisan support and have waited too long.

**My Request**

Please:

1. **Vote for a clean CR** to reopen the government this week
1. **Support S. 1032** and work with leadership to secure floor time or NDAA inclusion
1. **Engage your staff** on offset options for the Major Richard Star Act if cost remains a barrier

Both of these issues have clear solutions and strong support. What’s needed now is action.

Thank you for your consideration and your service to [State]. I look forward to your response.

Respectfully,

## Email #3: To House Member (Combined Focus)

**Subject: Constituent Request - Clean CR & H.R. 2102 (Major Richard Star Act)**

Dear Representative [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State] to request your support on two critical issues:

**1. Support a Clean Continuing Resolution**

The government shutdown—now in week four—is causing real harm:

- Federal courts furloughing staff and delaying cases
- National security agencies like NNSA operating at 20% capacity
- Federal workers and contractors facing severe financial strain
- [Local impact in your district]

Policy disagreements are legitimate, but they should not shut down government operations. **Please vote for a clean CR to reopen the government, then continue budget negotiations with agencies funded.**

**2. Advance H.R. 2102 - Major Richard Star Act**

H.R. 2102 now has over 300 bipartisan cosponsors—making it one of the most broadly supported bills in Congress. It corrects an unfair policy that forces combat-disabled retirees to offset earned military retirement against VA disability compensation.

These payments compensate different sacrifices: years of service (retirement) versus service-connected injuries (disability). They should not be offset against each other.

If the Senate needs offsets or phased implementation, the veteran community is open to those conversations—but the House should pass this bill cleanly and send a strong message.

**My Ask**

1. Vote YES on any clean continuing resolution to reopen the government
1. Cosponsor H.R. 2102 if you haven’t already (or thank you if you have!)
1. Push House leadership to bring H.R. 2102 to the floor for a vote

Both of these actions are urgent and have overwhelming support. Thank you for representing [District] and for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

## Email #4: To Committee Staff (Tactical/Technical)

**Subject: Major Richard Star Act - Offset Options & Path Forward**

Dear [Staffer Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding S. 1032 / H.R. 2102 (Major Richard Star Act) and potential paths forward this session.

**Current Status Summary**

- S. 1032: 70+ cosponsors; blocked for UC due to cost concerns
- H.R. 2102: 300+ cosponsors
- Veteran community: frustrated but pragmatic; open to offset discussions

**Potential Fiscal Solutions**

To address the concerns that have stalled floor action, we’ve identified several viable approaches that preserve the policy intent while managing the score:

1. **Phased eligibility** - Roll out by retirement cohort (e.g., start with pre-2010 retirees, expand annually)
- Smooths outlays; easier to score over 10-year window
- Delivers immediate relief to oldest/most acute cases
1. **Offset menu** - Standard Hill options with bipartisan precedent:
- Rescissions of unobligated balances in non-defense discretionary accounts
- Close niche tax expenditures (dozens with CBO revenue estimates available)
- Administrative efficiencies in VA claims processing (potential recapture)
1. **Review & cap provisions**
- 3-year GAO study on take-up rates, program integrity, and fiscal impact
- Sunset if abuses identified (extremely unlikely given eligibility criteria)

**Vehicle Options**

Given floor time constraints, we see three realistic paths:

- **Standalone floor vote** with UC after offset agreement
- **NDAA conference** - reintroduce amendment with offset language attached
- **Veterans omnibus** - package with other bipartisan VA bills if leadership assembles one

**Request**

Would your office be open to a brief (30-min) call or in-person meeting to discuss:

- Which offset approaches are most viable from the committee’s perspective
- CBO scoring questions/refinements
- Timeline for potential floor action or vehicle inclusion

Happy to coordinate with other stakeholder offices (cosponsors, VSO liaisons, etc.) to streamline the conversation.

The policy has overwhelming support; we just need to solve the procedural and fiscal mechanics. I believe we can get there this session with your help.

Thank you for your time and your work on behalf of veterans.

Best regards,

## Email #5: To Media/Press (Pitch for Coverage)

**Subject: Story Pitch - Government Shutdown Impact + Stalled Veterans Bill**

Dear [Journalist Name],

I’m reaching out with a timely story angle that connects two major issues currently stalled in Congress:

**1. Government Shutdown Impacts (Day 27)**

While much coverage focuses on political horse-trading, the real-world impacts are escalating:

- Federal judiciary furloughing staff nationwide - case backlogs mounting
- NNSA (nuclear security administration): 80% workforce furloughed
- [Local angle: Any federal facilities, contractors, or affected workers in your coverage area?]

**Story angle**: How is the shutdown affecting justice system access and national security operations? (Courts and nuclear security are not typical shutdown story focuses.)

**2. Major Richard Star Act - Bipartisan Bill Blocked Despite Huge Support**

- H.R. 2102: 300+ House cosponsors; S. 1032: 70+ Senate cosponsors
- Blocked in Senate over “cost” concerns despite broad bipartisan support
- Affects ~50,000 combat-disabled veterans who lose retirement pay dollar-for-dollar when they receive VA disability

**Story angle**: What does it say when a bill with 70% Senate support can’t get a vote? Veteran frustration + policy details + the “double dipping” myth.

**Human Element**

I can connect you with:

- Combat-disabled retirees affected by the offset (compelling personal stories)
- Federal workers/contractors affected by shutdown in [your region]
- VSO advocates working both issues

Both stories offer timely local angles with national policy implications. Would you be interested in covering either or both? I’m happy to provide background materials, fact sheets, and source contacts.

Best regards,
