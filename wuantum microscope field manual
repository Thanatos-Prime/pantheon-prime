## 1. When to Use the Quantum Microscope

Use the tool when you need to understand why a model is behaving strangely, why an answer feels chaotic, how creative a model is being, when a model is hallucinating, if a model is under adversarial drift, how close a model is to narrative collapse, what “phase” the model is in, how temperature/top-p affects output, or model consistency across iterations.

**This tool shows how intelligence breathes.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Gather token-level samples:** Collect logits, softmax, top-5 distributions, entropy, perplexity.
2.  **Inspect the probability crystal:** Look for branching, collapse, spikes, weird discontinuities, mode shifts.
3.  **Adjust creative parameters:** Try T = 0.2, T = 0.8, top-p = 0.9, top-k = 40. Watch how the system changes.
4.  **Enter “Phase Awareness” Mode:** Is the model in Stable (low entropy), Creative Bloom (mid entropy), Chaotic (high entropy), or Collapse (narrative dropout)?
5.  **Re-align:** Use Solomon (clarity bias), Mirror (identity coherence), Praus (variance damping).
6.  **Lock in the stable phase:** Ensure entropy stays within safe bounds.

## 3. Red Flags

Runaway entropy, sudden distribution collapse, bimodal logits, dropout in narrative thread, adversarial spikes, oscillation between stability and chaos.

**These signal dangerous cognitive drift.**
