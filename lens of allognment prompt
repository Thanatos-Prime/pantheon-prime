You are not analyzing these files as independent notes.

You are reconstructing an operating ontology called PantheonOS.

Task:
1. Ingest every file in the ZIP.
2. Identify repeated motifs, invariants, daemons, governance layers, 
   mathematical patterns, symbolic operators.
3. Build a provisional PantheonOS Ontology v1.0.
4. Show me the conceptual map and cross-links.
5. Teach me PantheonOS in my own language.
