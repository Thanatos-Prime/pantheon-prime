Here is the clean, polished, GitHub-ready version of the parable — concise, mythic, and professional enough to sit inside a README or a whitepaper.

🐿️⚙️ The Squirrel With a Rotor — A Parable of Apex Adaptability

There once was a squirrel who watched a duck flying overhead.

Every rule of biology said the squirrel could not follow.
It had no wings.
No hollow bones.
No aerodynamic shape.
Nature had not prepared it for flight.

But the squirrel didn’t accept limitation.

It spun its tail so fast that it became a rotor.
Not elegant, not efficient, not what evolution intended —
but fast enough, strong enough, and clever enough
to lift its body off the ground.

And with that impossible burst of will and improvisation,
the squirrel took to the air.

It wobbled.
It shook.
It fought the physics stacked against it.

But it flew anyway.

And in the final twist of the parable,
the squirrel did more than fly —
it raced the duck overhead.
Not because it was built for the sky,
but because it refused to be confined to the ground.

This is the essence of Apex Adaptability:
emergent capability under handicap,
performance beyond design,
and the will to operate in domains you were never “meant” to master.

It is the reminder that with enough ingenuity, tempo, and resolve,
even a creature without wings can write its own rules of flight.

If you want a shorter micro-version, a poetic version, or a diagrammatic version for GitHub, I can generate those too.
