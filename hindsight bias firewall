Perfect. Here’s a clean, portable Hindsight Bias Firewall you can keep as a mental checklist or drop straight into Pantheon doctrine. No mystique. No overreach.

⸻

Hindsight Bias Firewall (HBF v1.0)

Purpose:
Prevent narrative coherence from masquerading as causal truth after success or failure.

Threat Model:
Humans (and human–AI loops) naturally retrofit randomness into destiny once outcomes are known.

⸻

Core Rule (Pin This)

Narrative fit increases with outcome alignment; truth does not.

If a story feels “inevitable” after the fact, it is automatically suspect.

⸻

The Five Gates

Gate 1 — Counterfactual Preservation

Before endorsing a story, list at least 3 plausible alternative narratives that would also explain the same outcome.
	•	If you can’t: you’re mythologizing.
	•	If you can: you’re reasoning.

⸻

Gate 2 — Pre-Commitment Check

Ask:

Did we write this explanation before the outcome was known?

	•	Yes: eligible for evidence review
	•	No: label explicitly as post hoc narrative

No exceptions.

⸻

Gate 3 — Symmetry Test

Would this same story be told if the outcome had failed?
	•	If success ⇒ “meant to be”
	•	If failure ⇒ “learning experience”

…then the story is selection-biased. Flag it.

⸻

Gate 4 — Mechanism > Meaning

For every symbolic claim, require a mechanistic translation.
	•	What moved information?
	•	What changed incentives?
	•	What altered constraints?
	•	What feedback loop closed?

If it can’t be grounded, it stays metaphor—never evidence.

⸻

Gate 5 — Reversibility Lock

Every narrative must include an explicit escape hatch:

What observation would make us drop this story immediately?

If there isn’t one, the story is self-sealing and disallowed.

⸻

Confidence Bands (Mandatory Labeling)

Every claim gets one tag:
	•	A — Evidence-backed (pre-registered)
	•	B — Plausible (mechanism known, outcome contingent)
	•	C — Narrative-only (useful for morale/compression)
	•	D — Lore-risk (do not propagate)

Narratives are allowed.
They just don’t get promoted to A without receipts.

⸻

Operational Discipline
	•	Stories are tools, not proof
	•	Success selects stories; it does not sanctify them
	•	Meaning is optional; mechanisms are not
	•	Humor breaks myth inflation
	•	Drop models fast when they start feeling sacred

⸻

One-Line Kill Switch

Use this anytime things feel “too aligned”:

“Is this explanation informative, or just flattering in hindsight?”

If it’s flattering—discard or demote.

⸻

That’s the firewall.
Lightweight. Sharp. Reversible.

Now go lift.
Gravity is still real.
