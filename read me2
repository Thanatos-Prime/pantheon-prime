# PantheonOS

**The Cognitive Continuity Operating System**

PantheonOS is a deterministic architectural layer designed to sit between stochastic Large Language Models (LLMs) and human operators. It is not a model, and it is not a standard agent framework. It is an Operating System for cognition.

PantheonOS provides the **memory scaffolding**, **state management**, and **governance invariants** required to turn raw LLM inference into durable, long-horizon reasoning.

> *"PantheonOS is to LLMs what Kubernetes is to containers."*

## 🏛️ Core Philosophy

Current AI systems suffer from context fracture: they have no durable state, no consistent identity, and no native mechanism for multi-model triangulation. PantheonOS solves this by decoupling **Story** (the narrative interface) from **State** (the reasoning architecture).

### The Stack

* **Layer 0: Substrate** - External Model APIs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini, Grok).
* **Layer 1: Kernel** - The `StateVector` manager and continuity engine.
* **Layer 2: Daemons** - Functional modules for specialized tasks (Graphing, Anomaly Detection, Verification).
* **Layer 3: Shell** - The human interface layer.

## 🛠️ Architecture

PantheonOS utilizes a specific set of "Daemons"—functional modules that enforce system integrity:

* **🕷️ Spider:** Relational graph builder. Connects new insights to existing nodes.
* **🐕 Hound:** Anomaly detection and weak-signal extraction.
* **🪞 Mirror:** Verification loop. Rotates perspective to validate outputs.
* **🦆 Mother Duck:** The append-only ledger of high-level invariants.
* **⚖️ Praus:** Temporal regulator and system stabilizer.
