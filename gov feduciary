I’m going to translate what you’re saying into a clean, serious, policy-grade position—because underneath the anger is a very defensible democratic principle.

⸻

The core principle (stated precisely)

Public funds are not government property.
They are collectively owned by the citizens and temporarily entrusted to elected officials for specific, limited purposes.

Government officials are fiduciaries, not owners.

⸻

Why this framing matters

When budgets are treated as government money, three pathologies emerge:
	1.	Moral hazard
Spending feels abstract and consequence-free to decision-makers.
	2.	Diffuse accountability
No individual is clearly responsible for waste because “the government” is a fog, not a person.
	3.	Consent erosion
Taxation shifts from delegated authority to assumed entitlement.

Your instinct is pointing at a real failure of civic framing.

⸻

A more exact way to say it (without inflammatory language)

Taxation is a compulsory contribution authorized by the people for shared needs.
That authority does not transfer ownership—only stewardship.

That’s not radical. That’s basic republican theory.

⸻

The fiduciary model (this is the key upgrade)

Government spending should be governed by the same principles that apply to:
	•	trustees
	•	pension fund managers
	•	corporate officers

Fiduciary duties applied to public budgets
	1.	Duty of loyalty
Spend only in the interest of the citizens, not donors, allies, or future employers.
	2.	Duty of care
Use reasonable diligence, cost-benefit analysis, and evidence.
	3.	Duty of purpose limitation
Funds raised for X cannot be casually diverted to Y.
	4.	Duty of transparency
Citizens must be able to trace where money goes and why.

Right now, these duties exist rhetorically—but are weakly enforced.

⸻

What treating it as “our money” would actually change (concretely)

1. Budgets would require plain-language justification

No more thousand-page bills nobody reads.
Every major allocation answers:
	•	What problem?
	•	Why this method?
	•	What metric determines success or failure?

2. Spending would default to sunset clauses

Money expires unless results are demonstrated.
No eternal programs by inertia.

3. Officials would face personal consequences

Not jail for policy disagreement—but:
	•	removal
	•	pension clawbacks
	•	disqualification for gross negligence or deception

That’s normal fiduciary enforcement elsewhere.

4. Citizens regain standing

Waste wouldn’t just be “political.”
It would be a breach of trust.

⸻

Important correction (this strengthens your case)

Avoid framing this as “violence” or “coercion” in casual speech.

Why?

Because:
	•	all law involves compulsion
	•	the real issue is legitimacy and consent, not force itself

The stronger claim is:

Taxation is legitimate only when constrained, transparent, and accountable to those who provide it.

That’s hard to argue against in a free society.

⸻

Bottom line (tight and defensible)

The government does not own public money.
It administers it on behalf of the people, under delegated authority, with enforceable duties.
When that stewardship is abused, it is not politics—it is a breach of trust.

If you want, next we can:
	•	draft a “Public Money Bill of Rights”
	•	design a citizen-ledger / audit model
	•	or turn this into a speech or manifesto that lands with moderates and skeptics

Just tell me which lane you want.
