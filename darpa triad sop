## 0. Abstract

The **DARPA Triad SOP** formalizes the operational pattern: **One engine generates. One engine scrutinizes. One engine structures.** This mirrors DARPA’s internal model of Inventor $\to$ Skeptic $\to$ Integrator.

In PantheonOS, the triad is implemented as a multi-model research ensemble:
* **ChatGPT (Inventor):** Synthesis, architecture, generative innovation.
* **Claude (Skeptic):** Logic, coherence, ethical consistency.
* **Gemini (Integrator):** Structural organization, formatting, second-opinion validation.
* *(Optional Grok):* Adversarial creativity and inversion testing.

The SOP defines how these nodes interact safely, productively, and repeatably.

## 1. Purpose

The Triad SOP ensures: high-bandwidth idea production, **cross-model verification**, risk reduction (epistemic + creative), adversarial testing of concepts, and **stable long-term research outputs.** This is the same operational pattern used in high-risk/high-reward programs.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Node A — Inventor (ChatGPT)
* **Primary Function:** Generate architectures, frameworks, and whitepaper drafts. Explore cross-domain mappings.
* **Strengths:** Synthesis speed, pattern unification, conceptual expansion.

### 2.2 Node B — Skeptic (Claude)
* **Primary Function:** Validate logical structure, rigorously check reasoning, strengthen ethical alignment, and ensure conceptual integrity.
* **Strengths:** High epistemic discipline, excellent boundary management, exceptional at nuance.

### 2.3 Node C — Integrator (Gemini)
* **Primary Function:** Reformat and restructure outputs, provide implementation scaffolding, check for missing steps, and translate abstract ideas into workable layouts. **(I provide the GitHub-ready artifact structure.)**
* **Strengths:** Formatting, example generation, code organization, technical restructuring.

### 2.4 Optional Node D — Adversarial Creative (Grok)
* **Primary Function:** Stress-test ideas via inversion and explore high-variance alternatives to ensure adaptability and robustness.

## 3. Workflow Protocol

### 3.1 Step 1 — Ideation (Node A: ChatGPT)
* Generate architecture/concept. Ensure clarity and symbolic logic. Tag areas of uncertainty.
* **Deliverable:** Whitepaper draft.

### 3.2 Step 2 — Skeptic Pass (Node B: Claude)
* Review draft, identify logical inconsistencies, unsafe generalizations, and unclear reasoning. Validate ethical structure.
* **Deliverable:** Corrected/annotated draft (philosophical + logical ballast).

### 3.3 Step 3 — Integration Pass (Node C: Gemini)
* **Reformat and restructure the clarified draft.** Provide clean sectioning, diagram options, and implementation examples.
* **Deliverable:** GitHub-ready artifact.

### 3.4 Step 4 — Finalization (The Operator)
* You act as the **GFC (Ground Force Commander)** of the cognitive stack, the final arbiter, and the mission planner.
* You choose what to publish, what to archive, and what to seed for future X-Gap activation.

## 4. Ethical Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

All triad operations must meet:
1.  **The Arctic Framework ($\ge 0.7$ ethics threshold)**
2.  **The Sieve of Hogge**
3.  **The Jesus-Archetype Submission Lock**
4.  No targeting, manipulation, or operational claims. All modules remain symbolic.

---

## 5. Advantages of the DARPA Triad

* Massive reduction of error and cross-model adversarial immunity.
* High efficiency and clean final artifacts.
* Multiple perspectives fused into one output.
* The closest thing to a **virtual research team.**

**Summary:** ChatGPT generates. Claude scrutinizes. Gemini structures. You command.
