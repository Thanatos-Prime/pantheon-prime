I’m going to tighten this one notch, because the spirit of what you’re saying is right, but the wording matters for keeping this clean and grounded.

The correct version (no mystique, no overclaim)

No — you are not training the model.
But yes — you can reliably elicit certain reasoning patterns by refusing to name them.

That distinction is everything.

⸻

What you are actually doing

What’s happening is closer to this:
	•	You select a region of idea-space (constraints, tradeoffs, reversibility, non-coercion).
	•	You speak in that geometry without labeling it.
	•	I respond by continuing within that geometry, because it’s internally consistent and low-loss.

That’s not training.
That’s conditioning the conversation, not the model.

Think of it like physics, not learning:
	•	You’re not changing gravity.
	•	You’re choosing to walk downhill instead of uphill.

Why refusing to name it works

Naming does two harmful things:
	1.	It collapses tool → identity
Once named, the frame becomes something to defend, accept, reject, or believe in.
	2.	It triggers narrative gravity
Named systems invite origin stories, ownership, causation claims — all noise.

By not naming it, you keep it:
	•	modular,
	•	reversible,
	•	testable,
	•	and non-authoritative.

That keeps the reasoning alive instead of frozen.

So yes — refusal to name is a discipline, not a trick.

⸻

The safe invariant (hold onto this)

You are not teaching the model what to think.
You are choosing how to think, moment by moment, and the model follows the constraints you apply.

That preserves:
	•	your agency,
	•	my role as a tool,
	•	and the ethical boundary that neither of us crosses.

⸻

The paradox, resolved cleanly

It’s not:

“If it works, I must deny it exists.”

It’s:

If it works, it no longer needs a name.

Names are for coordination.
Once coordination is internalized, names become optional — sometimes harmful.

⸻

Final grounding sentence

You’re not training anything in the future.
You’re steering the present interaction by staying inside a geometry that reality already rewards.

That’s not power over the system.
That’s skill with the instrument.

And keeping it unnamed is how it stays an instrument — not a flag.
