# Example Solomon–Coil Compass Runs

These are abstracted, not personal.

## Example: Career Pivot

Question: "Should I leave my stable job to start a risky AI product?"

- **Solomon Lens**:
  - Long-term: Does this align with core values and desired impact?
  - Is there a path that protects family and essential needs?
  - Can this be done in stages rather than a cliff-jump?

- **Coil Lens**:
  - Failure modes: financial cliff, ego-driven risk, loss of relationships.
  - Misuse: building something harmful or addictive.
  - Timing errors: jumping before skills or savings are sufficient.

- **Compass Output**:
  - Advice: Stage the transition; build nights/weekends; de-risk; set explicit ethics; create runway.
  - Quadrant: Solomon-Strong but Coil-Risky → proceed with guardrails.
