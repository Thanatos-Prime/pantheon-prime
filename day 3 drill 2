Day 3 (A) is ship-grade. You built a coordinator that’s implementable in <2 weeks, you kept composition with v0.2, and you handled the nasty real-world edges (ghost claims, clock skew, read-only DB, malicious daemons) with clean, testable mitigations. Also: the two curriculum upgrades (Spec Surface Map + Operating Conditions) immediately make this usable by teams.

A few surgical tighten-ups to make this survive a truly hostile SRE/security review—no rewrites, just spec precision:

5 precision patches (small, high leverage)

Patch A — Make task completion idempotency explicitly keyed

Right now “complete is idempotent” is stated, but not how.

Add (Normative):
	•	POST /tasks/:id/complete MUST accept an idempotency_key (or reuse message_id) and MUST treat repeat submissions with the same key as no-ops returning the same completion receipt.

Why: late completion + retries + coordinator restart becomes provably safe.

Patch B — Clarify “exclusive claim” is per active lease

You say “at most one daemon at a time,” but define it precisely:
	•	A task MUST have at most one active lease at any moment.
	•	A task MAY be executed more than once across time if leases expire (at-least-once).

This prevents reviewers from claiming you promised exactly-once.

Patch C — Coordinator restart ghost-claim resolution via “claim receipts”

Idempotent claim tokens are good; make the return type explicit:
	•	Claim response MUST include claim_receipt_id (UUID).
	•	Daemon MUST include claim_receipt_id on renew/complete/fail calls.
	•	Coordinator MUST reject renew/complete/fail if receipt doesn’t match current lease holder (409).

This slams the door on “daemon completes someone else’s task.”

Patch D — Split-brain operator control: enforce singleton by storage lock

You correctly scoped split-brain out-of-scope, but you can still give an operator-enforceable mitigation without consensus:
	•	Coordinator MUST acquire a database advisory lock (or equivalent) on startup and MUST exit if lock cannot be acquired.

This keeps “single coordinator” true in practice.

Patch E — Define coordinator durability boundary (what’s “persisted”?)

When you say “tasks not lost if coordinator restarts,” define “durable”:
	•	A task submission MUST return 201 only after task is committed to durable storage.
	•	A claim MUST be persisted (lease written) before coordinator returns 200.

Otherwise lawyers will eat you alive on “lost” semantics.

One missing test category (add 3 tests)

You have strong tests, but add a specific trio:
	1.	test_complete_idempotency_key_replay()
	2.	test_claim_receipt_mismatch_rejected()
	3.	test_singleton_startup_db_lock_enforced()

These map directly to the patches above and close the last audit holes.

Assessment
	•	Architecture: ✅ correct for 2-week implementation and aligns with your hot-standby/watcher model
	•	Failure boundaries: ✅ well-defined, honest non-guarantees
	•	Spec discipline: ✅ RFC 2119 + operating conditions + surfaces = pro-level
	•	Publishability: ✅ this can be a repo RFC today

⸻

Next move (pick one)
	1.	Apply the 5 precision patches and update traceability/tests (fast, ~10 minutes)
	2.	Day 4 — Compression & Communication: produce the same spec as (a) 2-sentence executive summary, (b) 200-word brief, (c) 20-bullet implementer guide, (d) one architecture diagram, (e) decision matrix
	3.	Portability test: apply Modules 1–3 to a non-software artifact (e.g., Richard Star Act campaign ops plan) to prove generalization

Say 1, 2, or 3.
