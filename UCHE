Good.
If we’re going to do this, we do it clean — no fantasy fluff, no vague “it sniffs vibes.”

We formalize a Universal Constant-Hunting Engine.

The Truffle Pig is not mystical.
It’s a renormalization + invariance detector.

Let’s build it.

⸻

🐗 Truffle Pig — Universal Constant Hunter (v1.0)

Core Mission

Detect domain-independent invariants under transformation.

A “constant” is defined as:

A quantity that remains stable under repeated transformation, scaling, or domain shift.

If it converges under zoom, rescale, perturbation, or reparameterization → candidate constant.

⸻

I. The Four Primary Detection Mechanisms

The Pig must operate across all terrains using these operators:

⸻

1️⃣ Fixed-Point Detection

Apply transformation T repeatedly:

x_{n+1} = T(x_n)

If:

T(x^*) = x^*

Convergent fixed point found → potential constant.

Examples:
	•	φ
	•	Feigenbaum α, δ
	•	Critical exponents

⸻

2️⃣ Scaling Ratio Convergence

Zoom into system at multiple resolutions.

Compute ratio between successive scales:

\frac{\Delta_{n}}{\Delta_{n+1}}

If ratio → constant → universality class detected.

This is how δ was discovered.

⸻

3️⃣ Spectral Eigenvalue Extraction

Define operator L.

Solve:

L\psi = \lambda \psi

Eigenvalues λ that persist across system variations → structural constants.

Examples:
	•	π in Laplacian systems
	•	Natural frequencies
	•	Stability thresholds

⸻

4️⃣ Entropy / Compression Stability

Measure information reduction across partitioning schemes.

If entropy ratios stabilize under refinement → invariant.

Example:
	•	ln 2
	•	Shannon limits
	•	Kolmogorov scaling constants

⸻

II. Cross-Domain Terrain Map

Pig must operate in:

Terrain	Operator
Geometry	Laplacian / metric
Dynamics	Iterative maps
Networks	Graph spectrum
Information	Entropy metrics
Economics	Feedback elasticity
Biology	Growth recursion
Neural systems	Oscillatory modes
Markets	Volatility scaling
Language	Compression ratios


⸻

III. General Constant-Hunting Algorithm
	1.	Identify symmetry or recursion.
	2.	Apply perturbation.
	3.	Zoom / rescale.
	4.	Normalize.
	5.	Check convergence.
	6.	If stable under transformation → log candidate constant.

If it disappears under small perturbation → discard.

IV. Goblin Financier — Deployment Layer

Goblin evaluates:

• Portability score
• Regime stability
• Domain overlap
• Predictive leverage
• Collapse boundary utility

Constants with high cross-domain portability → high asset value.

⸻

V. Universal Meta-Rule

Every constant belongs to a universality class.

If two systems share:

• Same symmetry
• Same nonlinearity order
• Same conservation law
• Same dimensional constraint

They share constants.

The Pig’s job is to detect universality classes.

⸻

VI. How New Constants Are Found

They appear when:

• A symmetry breaks
• A phase transition occurs
• A renormalization fixed point exists
• A scaling law converges

So the Pig must actively search near:

Instability boundaries.

That’s where constants hide.

⸻

VII. Deep Principle

Constants are not “numbers.”

They are:

Stable attractors in transformation space.

The Pig hunts attractors.

The Goblin banks attractors.

⸻

VIII. Final Upgrade — Terrain-Agnostic Mode

Train the Pig to always ask:
	1.	What transforms?
	2.	What survives transformation?
	3.	What converges under zoom?
	4.	What resists perturbation?

That’s it.

If something survives all four → high-value constant.

⸻

Now let me ask you something sharper:

Do you want this Pig optimized for:

A) Discovery of new mathematical constants
B) Detection of regime collapse boundaries
C) Predictive invariants for real-world systems
D) Meta-constants — invariants of invariance

Choose the priority.

Because optimizing for all equally reduces performance.
