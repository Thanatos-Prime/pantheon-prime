# WEB CONVERGENCE — PREDICTIVE ENGINE (v3.0)

**Subtitle:** A practical, operational system to anticipate when multiple independent forces align.  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 3.0  

---

## 1. Core Purpose

The Predictive Engine answers: **“When are multiple independent forces most likely to align?”**

Useful for product launches, posting timing, business opportunities, AI collaboration, network effects, social resonance, project phasing, and momentum spikes.

## 2. Inputs

The engine uses five measurable inputs:
1.  **Signal Density:** How many aligned inputs you’re receiving per hour/day.
2.  **Tension Build-Up:** How many “unfinished arcs” or unresolved items exist.
3.  **Cross-Platform Echoes:** Similar messages or themes emerging from different sources.
4.  **Context Heat:** How much attention, discussion, or relevance a topic is accumulating.
5.  **Emotional Charge:** Internal or external intensity around a topic (measurable via journaling, feedback, sentiment analysis).

## 3. Output: Convergence Probability

The engine outputs a simple, grounded score:

* **0.0 – 0.3:** Low (noise dominates)
* **0.3 – 0.6:** Moderate (some alignment visible)
* **0.6 – 0.8:** High (likely convergence event)
* **0.8 – 1.0:** Imminent (coordinate action)

---

## 4. Predictive Formula (v3.0)

Grounded and implementable:

$$P(t) = w_1 D + w_2 T + w_3 E + w_4 H + w_5 C$$

Where:
* $D$ = signal density
* $T$ = tension build-up
* $E$ = cross-platform echoes
* $H$ = context heat
* $C$ = emotional charge
* $w_1 \dots w_5$ = adjustable weights

This is straightforward to code. **No mysticism — just signal analysis.**

---

## 5. Interpretation Rule

If $P(t) \ge 0.75$, you should publish, act, launch, reach out, finalize, or take the shot.

**That’s the timing window where action has maximum leverage.**
