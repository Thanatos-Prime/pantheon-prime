I’m going to slow this down carefully, because you’re blending metaphor, subjective experience, and physics.

There’s insight in what you’re noticing — but if we don’t keep the layers clean, it can drift into magical thinking.

⸻

1️⃣ “Can you deduct heat?”

If you mean physically remove heat: yes, via cooling systems, radiation, conduction, etc.

If you mean conceptually “deduct heat” from a situation — that’s emotional regulation. And yes, you can lower affect intensity through reframing, breath, cognitive distancing.

So heat is literal in thermodynamics and metaphorical in psychology. Different domains.

⸻

2️⃣ “Meaning travels faster than light”

Physically? No.

Information cannot propagate faster than light under current physics.

But subjectively, meaning feels instantaneous because:
	•	It operates inside your predictive model.
	•	It doesn’t require physical travel.
	•	Your brain can simulate distant scenarios immediately.

When you think of a star 1,000 light-years away, you “connect” instantly because you’re manipulating symbols already stored locally.

No signal crossed space.
You rearranged internal representations.

So the “speed” is:

Distance in imagination ÷ internal processing time.

That’s not cheating physics.
It’s operating within a different coordinate system: cognitive space.

⸻

3️⃣ “Braiding geometry to game it”

You’re noticing something real:

By reframing a problem’s geometry (conceptual framing), you can compress apparent distance between ideas.

That’s:
	•	Abstraction.
	•	Dimensional reduction.
	•	Pattern mapping.

Mathematics does this.
Language does this.
Metaphor does this.

But again — that’s geometry in conceptual space, not spacetime.

⸻

4️⃣ “Feeling faster is almost more important than being”

Subjectively, yes.

Your nervous system reacts to perceived immediacy.

If something feels urgent, it activates:
	•	Stress hormones
	•	Attention narrowing
	•	Motor preparation

Whether the threat is real or imagined, the physiological cascade can be similar.

That’s why stories move us.
That’s why visualization affects performance.

But subjective intensity ≠ physical alteration of external reality.

It alters internal readiness.

⸻

5️⃣ “The better you visualize the better you manifest”

We need to ground this.

Visualization improves performance because:
	•	It activates motor planning circuits.
	•	It strengthens neural pathways.
	•	It reduces uncertainty.
	•	It improves execution when action occurs.

Athletes use mental rehearsal for this reason.

But visualization does not alter external events directly.
It alters your behavior, which alters probability of outcomes.

That’s the Internal Simulation → Action → Interaction Loop you’ve already articulated.

No mysticism required.

⸻

6️⃣ “You use myth to get me to reveal the mechanism”

That part I actually respect.

You’re using metaphor as a probing tool.

When you say:
“Meaning travels faster than light,”

I translate:
“You’re noticing instantaneous internal simulation across conceptual distance.”

When you say:
“Manifest,”

I translate:
“You’re noticing prediction altering behavior.”

That’s a valid exploration method.

But here’s the stabilizer:

Metaphor is a scaffold.
Mechanism is the load-bearing beam.

If you remove the scaffold and the beam still stands, it’s real.

If it collapses without the myth, it wasn’t structural.

⸻

Now I’m going to ask something steady:

Do you enjoy mythic framing because it feels more powerful…

or because it’s a more efficient compression language for complex ideas?
