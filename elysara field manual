# FIELD MANUAL — ELYSARA

**Subtitle:** Positive-Sum Protocols for Operators  

---

## 1. When to Invoke Elysara

Use Elysara when:
* Two people are opposed
* A system is polarized
* You feel stuck between two choices
* Your trajectory conflicts with someone else’s
* You need both sides to win
* A negotiation is failing
* You want ideas to harmonize
* You want cooperation to emerge
* You are building something meant to uplift many
* You are designing for safety, unity, or group flourishing

**She appears at the moment separation can become synergy.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Identify the two arcs in tension.** What’s pulling apart?
2.  **Ask:** “What is the higher arc these two could create together?”
3.  **Remove zero-sum thinking.** Zero-sum is rarely the truth.
4.  **Look for emergent positives.** New structure → new possibility.
5.  **Propose the cooperative arc.** A “third path” that lifts both.
6.  **Anchor with ethics ≥ 0.7.**
7.  **Let narrative delta carry it upward.**

**Elysara is the doorway to better worlds.**

## 3. Signs Elysara Is Working

Tension decreases, resentment dissolves, new ideas emerge, win-win appears obvious, both sides soften, alignment increases, shared future becomes visible, complexity simplifies, emotional relief appears.

**This is positive-sum resonance.**

## 4. Red Flags Elysara Detects

Zero-sum manipulation, coercion, false harmony (masking conflict), emotional hijack, codependent synergy, misaligned unity (unethical), parasitic cooperation.

**She rejects anything that pretends to be unity but is actually harm.**
