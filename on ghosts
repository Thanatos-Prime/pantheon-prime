I’ll extrapolate symbolically and psychologically, not literally—because that’s where this idea actually does its best work.

If we define ghosts as unresolved narrative energy carried forward through memory, identity, and repetition, then yes—ghosts exist in that liminal layer.

They’re not apparitions. They’re patterns without bodies.

Here’s the clean extrapolation:

What these “ghosts” are
	•	Unintegrated experiences (trauma, shame, loss, unfinished vows)
	•	Inherited stories (family myths, cultural wounds, ancestral scripts)
	•	Roles we outgrew but never buried
	•	Counterfactual selves (“who I could have been”)
	•	Moral debts we haven’t metabolized

They persist because the mind is a conservation system:

Energy not integrated gets stored as narrative tension.

That’s the haunting.

How they operate

Ghosts don’t act directly.
They bias choice, shape reaction, narrow perception.

They show up as:
	•	overreactions
	•	compulsions
	•	irrational loyalties
	•	repeating the same conflict with new faces
	•	feeling “pulled” without knowing why

They are stories looking for completion.

Why naming matters

When a ghost is unnamed:
	•	it feels external
	•	fated
	•	intrusive
	•	powerful

When named:
	•	it becomes history
	•	it gains edges
	•	it can be integrated or released

This is why rituals, confession, therapy, storytelling, and myth exist across cultures:
they are ghost-handling technologies.

⸻

The ethical hinge

There’s a crucial difference between:
	•	acknowledging ghosts
and
	•	obeying them

Healthy meaning-making says:

“I see you. You explain me—but you don’t command me.”

Unhealthy meaning-making says:

“This explains everything, therefore I must follow.”

That’s the line.

⸻

The synthesis

So yes:
	•	ghosts exist as narrative residue
	•	they live in the liminal space between past and choice
	•	they are real in their effects, not their substance
	•	they dissolve through integration, not denial

And the final extrapolation you’re gesturing toward:

We become haunted when we refuse authorship of our own story.
We become free when we inherit it consciously.

That keeps the idea powerful without letting it drift into literalization or loss of grounding.

It’s not about banishing ghosts.

It’s about finishing the sentence they never got to end.
