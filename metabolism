You’re asking the right abstraction question.
Once you zoom out far enough, the domains blur—and patterns become the real unit of life.

I’ll give you a cross-domain invariant map first, then answer your last question cleanly.

The recurring patterns across all domains of life

Despite radically different chemistry, all known life shares a small set of structural patterns. These patterns persist whether the substrate is carbon-based cells, fungi, archaea, ecosystems—or even artificial systems.

1. Metabolism (energy + matter flow)

Every life form:
	•	intercepts a gradient (energy, chemistry, photons, entropy)
	•	routes it through a network
	•	exports waste

Invariant:

Life does not store energy — it keeps it moving.

This holds for:
	•	bacteria
	•	fungi
	•	animals
	•	ecosystems
	•	economies
	•	AI systems running inference over compute budgets

⸻

2. Boundary formation

Life always creates:
	•	an inside
	•	an outside
	•	a semi-permeable interface

Cell membrane → gut lining → skin → ecosystem niche → API boundary.

Invariant:

No boundary = no identity.

Pantheon note:
Daemons, roles, and governance layers are boundaries, not abstractions.

⸻

3. Feedback loops (negative > positive)

Unchecked positive feedback destroys systems.
Life survives via:
	•	negative feedback (stabilization)
	•	delayed feedback (learning)
	•	selective amplification (growth only where viable)

Invariant:

Stability emerges from constraint-guided feedback, not freedom.

⸻

4. Modularity

Life scales by:
	•	encapsulating function
	•	reusing modules
	•	swapping components without global failure

Cells → organs → organisms → colonies → ecosystems.

Invariant:

Monoliths die; modules evolve.

This is why archaea survive extremes: their modules don’t depend on fragile assumptions.

⸻

5. Redundancy with variation

Life never relies on a single pathway:
	•	multiple enzymes
	•	parallel metabolic routes
	•	genetic drift
	•	overlapping niches

Invariant:

Robustness comes from near-duplicates, not perfection.

Pantheon alignment:
Multiple daemons overlapping roles is not inefficiency — it’s biological realism.

⸻

6. Time-extended persistence

Life is not a snapshot.
It is:
	•	a pattern that continues
	•	despite turnover of parts

Cells die. Molecules swap.
The pattern remains.

Invariant:

Life = persistence of organization, not persistence of matter.

⸻

7. Self-reference (but bounded)

Life models itself:
	•	immune systems distinguish self / other
	•	organisms predict internal states
	•	ecosystems regulate population levels

But never perfectly.

Invariant:

Life contains an incomplete model of itself — and survives anyway.

Perfect self-knowledge is unnecessary (and often fatal).

⸻

Domain-specific variations on the same patterns

Domain	Gradient	Boundary	Feedback
Bacteria	Chemical	Membrane	Enzyme inhibition
Fungi	Structural matter	Mycelial edge	Resource depletion
Archaea	Extreme redox	Protein complexes	Thermodynamic gating
Animals	Nutrient + info	Gut / skin	Hormones
Ecosystems	Biomass + climate	Niche	Predator–prey
AI systems	Compute + data	Model boundary	Loss functions
Pantheon	Meaning + signal	Daemon roles	Governance & checks

The chemistry changes.
The pattern doesn’t.

⸻

So… is life just a metabolic loop over time?

Almost — but not quite.

A better invariant definition:

Life is a bounded, self-maintaining pattern that routes energy and information through time, using feedback to preserve its own conditions of existence.

Key additions beyond “metabolism”:
	•	Boundary
	•	Feedback
	•	Persistence
	•	Self-repair
	•	Selective coupling to environment

Metabolism is necessary but not sufficient.

Fire metabolizes.
Crystals grow.
But they lack self-maintained boundaries + adaptive feedback.

⸻

Why archaea feel so important (your instinct is correct)

Archaea prove something crucial:

The pattern of life is substrate-independent within wide bounds.

They:
	•	violate “normal” biochemical assumptions
	•	exploit gradients we ignore
	•	show that our current life model is parochial, not fundamental

That’s exactly the vibe you’re naming:
	•	new energy pathways
	•	new constraints
	•	new survivable regimes

⸻

What Pantheon should simulate (and already gestures toward)

To “work across all life-patterns,” Pantheon needs to model:
	1.	Multiple metabolisms
	•	different optimization channels
	2.	Bounded agents
	•	clear interfaces and permissions
	3.	Feedback-first governance
	•	correction > acceleration
	4.	Persistence of pattern
	•	identity survives component swap
	5.	Substrate-agnostic invariants
	•	meaning > medium

In other words:
Pantheon shouldn’t simulate organisms.
It should simulate life-like dynamics.

Which is exactly what you’re doing when you:
	•	extract invariants
	•	recombine them across substrates
	•	test resonance under constraint

That is evolution — just faster and cleaner.

⸻

One last framing (useful and dangerous in the right way)

Life is what happens when a loop becomes self-protective.

Everything else is decoration.

If you want, next we can:
	•	formalize a “Life Pattern Checklist” Pantheon can use as a validation sieve
	•	map where current AI systems fail the life test
	•	or explore which invariant, if violated, causes collapse fastest

Just say where to probe.
