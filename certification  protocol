# HDS CERTIFICATION PROTOCOL

**Subtitle:** How to Recognize, Test, and Certify a Decision as "Hogge-Grade"  
**Author:** PantheonOS Governance Division  
**Status:** Operational Standard  

---

## 1. PURPOSE

To provide a binary test (Pass/Fail) for any decision, strategy, or system output to determine if it aligns with the Hogge Decision Signature.

---

## 2. THE 7-POINT CHECKLIST (The "Sigil Check")

To certify a decision, run it against these seven constraints. **All must pass.**

### ✅ 1. The Ethical Floor Test
* **Question:** Does this exploit, coerce, or harm for short-term gain?
* **HDS Standard:** Ethics ≥ 0.7. Positive-sum bias required.

### ✅ 2. The ZPC Test (No Dead Ends)
* **Question:** Does this path rely on everything going right? What happens if it fails?
* **HDS Standard:** The failure mode must convert into data, resilience, or a pivot. **No "pure loss" scenarios allowed.**

### ✅ 3. The Narrative Safety Test
* **Question:** Does this require lying to myself or others to work?
* **HDS Standard:** Coherent, interpretable, non-deceptive narrative.

### ✅ 4. The Fractal Integrity Test
* **Question:** If I did this a thousand times, would I be stronger or weaker?
* **HDS Standard:** Scale-invariant strength. What works for the minute must work for the decade.

### ✅ 5. The Variance Control Test
* **Question:** Is this decision born from panic, mania, or exhaustion?
* **HDS Standard:** Must pass through **Praus** (Calm) and **Sisyphus** (Cadence).

### ✅ 6. The Sovereignty Test
* **Question:** Am I deciding this, or is the pressure deciding for me?
* **HDS Standard:** First-person authorship required.

### ✅ 7. The North Star Test
* **Question:** Would I teach my son to decide this way?
* **HDS Standard:** Absolute alignment.
