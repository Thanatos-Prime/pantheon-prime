# PANTHEON DIALECTIC — NEGOTIATION VARIANT

**Subtitle:** The high-leverage operator version for deals, diplomacy, conflict resolution.  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Ethics:** ≥ 0.7

## 1. Paradox (Tension)

Every negotiation contains a dual truth: **What they want** and **What you want**.

Name both explicitly. **“What are the two truths here?”** (No emotion. No assumptions. Just clarity.)

---

## 2. Parallax (Angle Reading)

Run the six-daemon angle scan:
* **Warhorse:** What does my body say? (pressure? openness?)
* **Dragonfly:** What’s the alternative angle I haven’t considered yet?
* **Spider:** What relationships/ties influence this?
* **Bombadil:** What is the calm ground truth?
* **Mirror:** What’s the ethical center?
* **Man Blinking Slower:** Is this the right time to push?

---

## 3. Transformation (The Bridge)

Transform both sides into a shared-interest frame:
* “your price vs my price” → fairness & stability
* “your timeline vs mine” → mutual efficiency
* “your risk vs my risk” → risk distribution

**This reveals the zone where both sides win.**

---

## 4. Invariant (The Non-Negotiable)

Extract the stable truth: **“What must remain true for this to be a good deal for me?”**

That becomes your line. Everything else flexes.
