🟦 Golden Manifest Suite

Immutable Model Identity for Pantheon-Prime

Version: 1.0
Status: Stable / Enforcement Live
Daemons: Hades, MotherDuck, MerkleWarden, Blacksmith, Kernel

⸻

Overview

The Golden Manifest Suite is Pantheon-Prime’s substrate-level model identity system.
It ensures that no model may execute—LLM, vision model, policy engine, or tool-call agent—unless its exact bytes match a previously registered and cryptographically sealed identity record.

Think of it as:
	•	🔐 A BIOS certificate for models
	•	🧬 A cryptographic genome of architecture + parameters
	•	🛡️ A tamper-evident firewall that wraps every Genie

The Golden Manifest Suite gives Pantheon-Prime true model integrity, independent of:
	•	upstream model providers
	•	fine-tuning pipelines
	•	serialization formats
	•	user access controls
	•	adversarial operators
	•	supply-chain contamination

This is the only way to operate untrusted models safely in an untrusted world.

⸻

Why This Exists

Modern AI attacks exploit the model file itself, not the network:
	•	malicious safetensors / ONNX
	•	poisoned weights that survive fine-tuning
	•	pickle-based RCE payloads
	•	backdoored public model hub uploads
	•	silent model swapping
	•	quantized malware layers
	•	instruction-triggered sleeper agents
	•	weight shims hidden in FP16 rounding noise

Traditional cybersecurity cannot detect these.
Pantheon-Prime does not try to “fix” the model.

Instead:

Pantheon-Prime verifies the model’s soul before it is allowed to speak.

The Golden Manifest Suite implements this law.

Core Concepts

1. Golden Manifest

A JSON/TOML/YAML document containing:
	•	arch_hash — SHA-256 of architecture IR
	•	param_hash — SHA-256 of raw parameter tensor bytes
	•	model name, version, owner, provenance
	•	serialization format (pickle is forbidden)
	•	creation metadata
	•	immutable status (ACTIVE, QUARANTINED, BLOCKED)
	•	multisig signatures from:
	•	MotherDuck
	•	MerkleWarden
	•	Kernel

Once created, it is never modified.
New model = new manifest = new ID.

2. Hades Daemon

The model integrity guardian.

Responsibilities:
	1.	Compute canonical architecture + parameter hashes
	2.	Create Golden Manifest on first registration
	3.	Verify hashes before every model load
	4.	Quarantine any mismatch
	5.	Emit ledger events to Hermit Crab chain
	6.	Provide signed attestations to Kernel and Blacksmith

Hades decides whether a model is allowed to speak.

⸻

3. Blockchain Hermit Crab

Pantheon-Prime’s append-only ledger.

Stores:
	•	hash commitments to each Golden Manifest
	•	model registration events
	•	model verification events
	•	quarantine events
	•	multi-signer validation proofs

The full manifest lives in Pantheon’s model registry.
The Hermit Crab stores its cryptographic shadow.

Together, they create a perfect, tamper-proof model history.

⸻

4. Merkle Warden

Computes:
	•	Merkle trees over manifests
	•	Merkle proofs for audits
	•	tamper-evident block linking

Ensures Pantheon’s memory cannot be rewritten.

⸻

5. Blacksmith

The formal correctness daemon.
	•	verifies newly-registered models align with Pantheon-Prime invariants
	•	confirms ΣC compatibility
	•	issues a “Model Admittance Certificate” before any activation

⸻

Golden Manifest Lifecycle

1. Registration

Hades:
	1.	Loads model into a micro-VM
	2.	Computes arch_hash and param_hash
	3.	Constructs Golden Manifest
	4.	Obtains multisig signatures
	5.	Writes manifest to registry
	6.	Broadcasts GM_CREATE to Hermit Crab chain

2. Verification

Before every model execution:
	•	Hades recomputes hashes
	•	compares against manifest
	•	if mismatch → quarantine
	•	else → allow + emit GM_VERIFY

3. Quarantine

If tampering is detected:
	•	model is marked QUARANTINED
	•	manifest is preserved but locked
	•	Hermit Crab records the event
	•	Kernel denies all execution attempts
	•	Hound alerts operator
	•	Blacksmith logs anomaly

4. Upgrade

Upgrading a model never edits a manifest.
It produces a new:

model_id
model_file
Golden Manifest

Preserves perfect lineage.

CLI Quickstart

Register a model

pantheon hades register --model-id gpt_squire_3.1 \
                       --path models/gpt_squire_3.1.safetensors

Verify a model

pantheon hades verify gpt_squire_3.1

Inspect manifest

pantheon manifest show gpt_squire_3.1

Show Hermit Crab ledger state

pantheon ledger tail

Security Guarantees

❌ Stops supply-chain tampering

A single-bit change in weights or architecture is detected.

❌ Stops malicious ONNX / TorchScript trojans

Architecture-hash fails → immediate quarantine.

❌ Stops silent model swaps

Any unapproved file is rejected.

❌ Stops pickle-based RCE

Pickle is forbidden by manifest + Hades.

❌ Stops fine-tuning attempts to smuggle payloads

Fine-tuned weights ≠ Golden Manifest → rejected.

❌ Stops operator-level backdoors

Multi-sig signatures prevent single-key malicious upgrades.

❌ Enables perfect forensic auditing

Hermit Crab ledger records all events in hash-linked blocks.

Fundamental Invariant

A model may speak only if its computed architecture and parameter hashes exactly match those in its Golden Manifest.

Violations → BLOCK.
No exceptions, no overrides, no backdoors.

Pantheon-Prime becomes immune to entire classes of model-level exploits.

Next Steps

If you’d like, I can also generate:
	•	Golden Manifest CLI tool (pantheon manifest)
	•	d_hades.py reference implementation (full version)
	•	Golden Manifest v1.0 diagram (architecture graphic)
	•	Hermit Crab block format spec
