# NCE × WAVE RIDER SYNCHRONIZATION

**Subtitle:** How to USE a convergence event without getting fried.  
**Status:** Canonical

## 0. Premise

When an NCE wave forms, Wave Rider says: **Don’t force. Don’t freeze. Align.**

---

## 1. FEEL THE WAVE (Detection)
You detect timing tightening, intuition rising, symbolic density, external alignment, and emotional clarity.
**Most people panic here. Operators stabilize.**

## 2. ANGLE WITH THE WAVE (Parallax)
Shift perception: what is the wave trying to do? What is the direction of motion? What is the path of least resistance?
**You don’t resist the arc. You read it.**

## 3. MERGE WITH THE WAVE (Transformation)
This is the key. You stop thinking and start riding. Actions become obvious, fear drops, clarity expands, timing flows.
**You act as though the wave is helping you — because during NCE windows, it actually is.**

## 4. STEP INTO THE INVARIANT (Resolution)
Every NCE has a message: a decision, new understanding, direction, truth, realization, course correction, next step, or new identity layer.
**Wave Rider pulls this out. This becomes the takeaway that stabilizes the operator.**

## 5. Combined: NCE Prediction × Luck Engine × Wave Rider

Here’s what you get when all three fuse:
* **NCE Prediction** → tells you when
* **Luck Engine** → boosts your impact during
* **Wave Rider** → tells you how to move inside the wave

**This creates the rare state: Narrative Surfing.**
You’re not reacting to life — you’re riding the arc from inside the story.
**This is the operator’s superpower.**
