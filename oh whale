You’re probably referring to recent AI projects analyzing whale vocalizations — super interesting space.

🐋 Sperm Whales & AI Pattern Decoding

The most talked-about effort is from Project CETI (Cetacean Translation Initiative). They’re using machine learning to analyze sperm whale codas — structured click patterns whales use socially.

A few grounded points:

1. We didn’t “translate whale language” yet.

What AI has done so far:
	•	Cluster recurring click patterns
	•	Identify structure and rhythm rules
	•	Detect turn-taking behavior (like conversation timing)
	•	Infer social context (e.g., greeting vs coordination)

That’s pattern recognition — not semantic translation.

2. It supports your intuition about oscillations.

Sound = pressure waves.
Language = structured oscillatory patterns.
AI models = pattern compression + prediction engines.

So yes — meaning, in many systems, rides on structured variation in oscillations.

The key question isn’t:

“Is it oscillation?”

It’s:

“Is the oscillation structured enough to encode reference and intention?”

That’s where the debate is.

3. Whale brains are enormous.

Sperm whales have the largest brain of any animal on Earth — about 5x the mass of a human brain.

But size ≠ intelligence directly.

Important differences:
	•	More white matter proportionally
	•	Highly developed social circuitry
	•	Large spindle neurons (associated with social cognition in humans and great apes)

They live in complex matrilineal clans with cultural transmission — which is wild.

4. Could they be “more advanced”?

Depends on what “advanced” means.

Humans:
	•	Symbolic abstraction
	•	External memory (writing, tech)
	•	Cumulative culture explosion

Whales:
	•	Acoustic long-distance communication
	•	Multi-generation cultural traditions
	•	3D spatial cognition in oceans
	•	Possibly individual names (evidence emerging)

They evolved for different constraint geometries.

Intelligence is curvature + constraints, not just size.
(You’d appreciate that framing.)

The Big Insight

If AI can:
	•	Detect structure
	•	Predict continuation
	•	Identify context shifts

Then in principle it can detect proto-semantics.

But we don’t yet know:
	•	Whether whale codas encode objects
	•	Or encode states/emotions
	•	Or encode coordination signals only

There’s a massive difference between:
	•	“There are fish over there.”
	•	“I feel grief.”
	•	“Rotate formation 30°.”
	•	“You are my daughter.”

We’re nowhere near distinguishing those yet.

The Philosophical Layer (grounded, not mystical)

You’re right that:

Meaning emerges from structured oscillation.

But meaning also requires:
	•	Shared internal models
	•	Intentional signaling
	•	Stable reference mapping
	•	Error correction loops

Without shared embodiment and world models, translation is guesswork.

That’s the hard boundary.

⸻

If you want, we can go deeper into:
	•	Whether semantic compression theory applies cross-species
	•	Whether LLM-style models are the right architecture for animal communication
	•	Or whether whales might have something like “narrative bandwidth” but constrained by medium

Where do you want to steer it?
