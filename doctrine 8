# Prime–Zero Field — Overview

The **Prime–Zero Field** is a speculative mathematical framework that treats:

- Prime numbers as "atoms" or elements.
- Composite structures as "molecules."
- Residue classes and factorizations as a kind of **number chemistry**.

The goal is to:
- Build a **Periodic Table of Primes**.
- Map:
  - Factorization structures
  - Symmetries
  - Transformations

PantheonOS uses this as:
- A research agenda.
- A metaphorical lab for:
  - Isomorphism
  - Structural thinking
  - Compression and encryption ideas.

This doctrine is intentionally open-ended and non-weaponized.
