# Zero-Positive Converter (ZPC) v1.0  
### Dimensional Elevation for Cooperative Value Creation  
**PantheonOS Research Group — 2025-11-23**

---

## 0. Abstract

The **Zero-Positive Converter** is a transformation engine that converts **zero-sum or adversarial frames** into **positive-sum, cooperative, value-expanding outcomes** through:

- dimensional elevation  
- payoff matrix lifting  
- reframing incentives  
- alliance-optimizing structural changes  
- mutual-benefit redesign  

This system is symbolic, ethical (≥0.7), and implements the Pantheon principle:

> **"Lift the game, not the players."**

## 1. Game-Theoretic Foundation

Let a 2-player game have payoff matrix:

\[
U =
\begin{bmatrix}
u_{11} & u_{12} \\
u_{21} & u_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Zero-sum implies:

\[
u_{ij}^{(1)} + u_{ij}^{(2)} = 0
\]

ZPC transforms this into:

\[
U' = U + \Delta
\]

Where \(\Delta\) represents **dimension-lifting**, defined as joint-value creation.

---

## 2. Dimensional Elevation

Define elevation operator \(E\):

\[
E: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n+k}
\]

Meaning:

- The game acquires new axes  
- New benefits become available  
- The payoff space expands instead of shifting  

### Examples of added dimensions:

- shared resources  
- shared goals  
- mutual reputation  
- common enemy  
- pooled risk  
- long-term relationship value  

---

## 3. Mathematical Form

Let original payoff be:

\[
U_0(s_1, s_2)
\]

Define elevation tensor:

\[
\Delta(s_1, s_2) = \lambda \cdot G(s_1, s_2)
\]

Where:

- \(\lambda\) = cooperation coefficient  
- \(G\) = growth function capturing joint benefit under chosen actions  

Then:

\[
U'(s_1, s_2) = U_0(s_1, s_2) + \lambda G(s_1, s_2)
\]

### Example Growth Function

\[
G(s_1, s_2) = 
\begin{cases}
g, & s_1 = s_2 = \text{cooperate} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Result:

\[
U'(\text{C}, \text{C}) = U_0(\text{C}, \text{C}) + \lambda g
\]

---

## 4. The ZPC Stability Condition

ZPC ensures positive-sum viability if:

\[
U'(\text{C}, \text{C}) > U'(\text{D}, \text{C}),\;
U'(\text{C}, \text{C}) > U'(\text{C}, \text{D})
\]

Meaning:

- cooperation becomes locally stable  
- defection becomes dominated  
- alliance is equilibrium

## 5. Zero-Positive Conversion Algorithm

Input:

- payoff matrix  
- resource vectors  
- long-horizon value models  
- strategic compatibility matrices  

Output:

- elevated payoff matrix  
- stability score  
- alliance recommendations

## 6. Pseudocode Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ZPCResult:
    U_original: np.ndarray
    U_elevated: np.ndarray
    stability_score: float


class ZeroPositiveConverter:
    def __init__(self, lambda_coef=1.0):
        self.lam = lambda_coef

    def growth_tensor(self, U):
        """
        Simple example: reward cooperation (0,0 entry for C,C).
        """
        G = np.zeros_like(U)
        G[0,0] = 1.0  # cooperation reward
        return G

    def elevate(self, U):
        G = self.growth_tensor(U)
        U_prime = U + self.lam * G

        # Stability score: difference between CC payoff and average defection payoff.
        CC = U_prime[0,0]
        D_avg = 0.5*(U_prime[1,0] + U_prime[0,1])
        stability = CC - D_avg

        return ZPCResult(U_original=U, U_elevated=U_prime, stability_score=stability)
