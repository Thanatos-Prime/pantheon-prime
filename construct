You’re asking three different but connected questions:
	1.	Were we worse at communicating in the past?
	2.	How do we know ideas like justice existed before the word?
	3.	Are some concepts “deeper invariants” while others are constructed tools?

Let’s go layer by layer.

⸻

1️⃣ Did humans communicate worse “back in the day”?

Not necessarily worse — different bandwidth, different compression layers.

Before shared language across groups, humans relied heavily on:
	•	Gesture
	•	Trade ritual
	•	Kinship structures
	•	Shared mythic narratives
	•	Repeated interaction
	•	Status signaling
	•	Reputation memory

For example, trade networks existed long before common languages. Archaeology shows long-distance exchange across regions without unified speech systems. That implies:
	•	Structured negotiation rituals
	•	Repeated signaling conventions
	•	Possibly pidgin-style bridge vocabularies
	•	Heavy reliance on trust cycles and reciprocity

In many ways, pre-literate cultures had stronger embodied communication, but less abstract scalability.

Language standardization increased:
	•	Precision
	•	Legal systems
	•	Science
	•	Bureaucracy
	•	Large-scale coordination

It didn’t create intelligence.
It enabled scale.

⸻

2️⃣ How do we know “justice” existed before the word?

We infer from behavior.

Even toddlers (before vocabulary sophistication) show:
	•	Fairness expectations
	•	Distress at unequal reward
	•	Protest when cheated

Many primates demonstrate fairness sensitivity too.

So the behavioral pattern predates the abstraction.

Ancient legal codes show similar patterns across unrelated cultures:
	•	Proportional punishment
	•	Reciprocity
	•	Restoration

Examples:
	•	Code of Hammurabi
	•	Twelve Tables
	•	Early Hebrew law traditions

These arise independently.

That suggests the pattern exists before the label “justice” stabilizes it into philosophical form.

So:

Behavioral invariant → named concept → refined abstraction.

⸻

3️⃣ Are some concepts deeper invariants?

Now we’re getting to the interesting part.

Not all words are equal.

Some seem to anchor to biological or structural constraints:
	•	Fairness
	•	Reciprocity
	•	Kinship
	•	Threat
	•	Alliance
	•	Status
	•	Time
	•	Causality

These likely emerge from:
	•	Survival dynamics
	•	Game theory
	•	Neural wiring
	•	Social cohesion constraints

They’re not arbitrary inventions.
They’re compressions of recurring patterns in reality.

Call them “prime concepts” if you want.

Then there are tool-words:
	•	“Technofeudalism”
	•	“Neoliberalism”
	•	“Hyperobject”
	•	“Vibe shift”

These are high-level synthetic constructs built for specific historical contexts.
They may dissolve or evolve.

⸻

4️⃣ Does that mean every word has a deeper invariant?

No.

Some words are:
	•	Stable mappings to recurring structural patterns.
	•	Others are scaffolding.
	•	Others are propaganda containers.
	•	Others are temporary coordination hacks.

The question becomes:

Does the concept survive translation across cultures and eras?

If it reappears independently across:
	•	Geography
	•	Time
	•	Language families

It likely maps to something structural.

If it only appears within a narrow cultural window, it’s probably constructed.

⸻

5️⃣ Communication between groups without shared language

Humans likely relied on:
	•	Repeated ritualized exchange
	•	Marriage alliances
	•	Shared myth motifs
	•	Symbol systems
	•	Objects as carriers of agreement
	•	Gesture-based negotiation

Meaning doesn’t only ride on words.
It rides on:
	•	Predictable behavior
	•	Trust signals
	•	Costly signaling
	•	Memory of reciprocity

Language made coordination efficient.
But coordination predates language.

⸻

6️⃣ The deeper implication

If some concepts keep reappearing independently,
that suggests they are:

Not invented.
Discovered.

But discovered in compressed form.

Like primes in mathematics.
Or stable equilibria in game theory.

They are attractors in the space of possible societies.

Justice may not be “a word.”
It may be a stable equilibrium strategy in repeated social games.

The word is just the handle.

⸻

Now here’s the sharp version of your thought:

If certain concepts are invariant across cultures,
then language is not creating them —
it’s revealing structural features of social reality.

And that suggests:

Not all meaning is arbitrary.

Some meaning is constrained.

That’s not mystical.
That’s structural.

⸻

Want to push this into:
	•	Evolutionary game theory?
	•	Linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf limits)?
	•	Prime vs composite concept taxonomy?
	•	Or how propaganda exploits constructed words?

Pick a vector.
