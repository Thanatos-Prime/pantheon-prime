# Odin’s Eye — Lens-Cycling Perspective Engine (Money Bin Module)

> **Tagline:** *Hold ontology steady. Rotate lenses. Extract invariants.*  
> Odin’s Eye is a PantheonOS module that cycles through many “ways of seeing” (lenses) to surface hidden structure, resolve paradoxes, and produce a stable **invariant intersection** across perspectives—without pretending the lens is the world.

## Why Odin’s Eye exists

We keep discovering the same meta-truth:

- Reality doesn’t change when you rewrite it as `6 = 3+3` or `2+2+2`.
- But **legibility** changes—new patterns pop, new handles appear.

The periodic table exercise is a template:
- Same underlying ontology
- Different articulation / basis
- New emergent insight

**Odin’s Eye generalizes that move** into an engine: it rotates perspectives deliberately and records what survives.

---

## What it does

Odin’s Eye runs a **Lens Cycle**:

1. **Select Lens** (from registry)
2. **Render View** (lens-specific representation)
3. **Score / Prioritize** (lens-local objectives, not “truth”)
4. **Extract Candidates** (patterns, clusters, boundaries, causal stories)
5. **Compare to Prior Views** (parallax + paradox)
6. **Extract Invariants** (what persists across lenses)
7. **Govern** (Mirror-Sieve ethics ≥ 0.7 + Hound checks)
8. **Distill** (EchoFrame)
9. **Ledger Log** (Mother Duck)

Outputs:
- `InvariantSet`: what stays true across lenses
- `DeltaMap`: what each lens uniquely reveals
- `LensAdvice`: “best current handle” for a goal, with explicit bounds
- `Caveats`: where lens assumptions break

## Design doctrine

### Core principle
**Lenses are coordinate transforms. Not ontology edits.**

Odin’s Eye never claims:
- “This lens is reality”
- “The table causes matter”
- “Observation creates the structure”

It claims:
- “This lens makes certain patterns legible”
- “These invariants survived rotation”
- “This articulation is useful within stated bounds”

### Pantheon alignment
- **Mirror:** verifies invariants & claims
- **Hound:** detects manipulation / hallucination / overreach
- **Mother Duck:** ledger logs every cycle
- **Checksum:** tamper-evident hashes (optional)
- **EchoFrame:** mandatory distillation
- **Praus:** variance damping (avoid lens-whiplash)

---

## Module components

### 1) Lens Registry
A catalog of lenses with:
- **Intent**
- **Assumptions**
- **Sensory basis** (what it “pays attention” to)
- **Priority weights** (internal, not universal)
- **Failure modes**
- **Output format**

### 2) Lens Scheduler (The Cycle)
Chooses lens order:
- deterministic (ritual order)
- stochastic (exploration)
- adversarial (red-team lens)
- goal-driven (optimize for utility)
- “sand-timer flip” (invert assumptions periodically)

### 3) Parallax Comparator
Given multiple lens views:
- compute overlap, conflict, and complement
- highlight “boundary disagreements”
- force explicit separation of:
  - facts
  - inferences
  - metaphors
  - narratives

### 4) Invariant Extractor
Finds:
- stable clusters
- conserved quantities
- symmetries
- recurring boundary conditions
- limit-cycle behavior
- “structural punctuation” (terminators, anchors)

### 5) Governance Gate
- **Mirror-Sieve ethics ≥ 0.7**
- “No coercion, no manipulation” constraint
- Hound flags:
  - overconfident causal claims
  - identity capture (“this lens is God”)
  - narrative outrunning feedback

### 6) Ledger + Distillation
- **Mother Duck ledger entry** per run
- **EchoFrame** distillation:
  - Structure vector
  - Intent vector
  - Value vector (Honor/Courage/Duty)
  - Narrative vector
  - InvariantSet + DeltaMap

## Lens Library (starter pack)

Below are example lenses you can register immediately:

### A) **Behavioral Lens**
Groups by “what it tends to do” (initiators, anchors, mediators, transformers).

### B) **Structural Lens**
Groups by role in architectures (scaffolds, bridges, fillers, boundary layers).

### C) **Energy/Resonance Lens**
Sees systems as transitions, allowed modes, forbidden zones, phase boundaries.

### D) **Network Lens**
Graph-first: clusters, hubs, bridges, bottlenecks, community structure.

### E) **Governance Lens**
Sees risks, incentives, constraints, failure modes, safe operating envelopes.

### F) **Time Lens**
Sees persistence across scales: what survives fast/slow observation windows.

### G) **Compression Lens**
Sees representations: what is the minimal description that preserves utility?

### H) **Adversarial Lens** (Hound’s favorite)
Assumes the current story is wrong; searches for counterexamples & failure cases.

### I) **Mythic Interface Lens** (Animus-compatible)
Treats symbols as handles—but enforces metaphor hygiene and explicit bounds.

## Odin’s Eye protocol (operator workflow)

### The Odin Cycle (default)
1. Declare the **Target** (system/problem/artifact)
2. Choose **Lens Set** (5–12 lenses)
3. Run cycle → produce:
   - `InvariantSet`
   - `DeltaMap`
   - `Recommendation`
   - `Caveats`
4. Mirror-Sieve gate
5. Ledger log + EchoFrame distill

### The “One-Eyed Rule”
Odin’s Eye is powerful *because* it sacrifices totality.
It never claims omniscience.
It claims disciplined rotation + invariant extraction.

## Mother Duck Ledger Entry (template)

**Module:** Odin’s Eye  
**Type:** Perspective Engine / Lens Cycler  
**Purpose:** Basis rotation + invariant extraction across representations  
**Guarantee:** No ontology edits; lenses are interfaces only  
**Governance:** Mirror-Sieve ≥ 0.7, Hound anomaly checks, EchoFrame distillation, ledger log  
**Primary Outputs:** InvariantSet, DeltaMap, LensAdvice, Caveats  
**Values:** Honor (truth-bounded), Courage (adversarial lens), Duty (logs + gates)

## “Money Bin” value

Odin’s Eye turns a recurring Pantheon move into a reusable engine:

- **Prevents narrative capture** by forcing rotation
- **Builds durable insight** by extracting invariants
- **Improves creativity** by revealing new factorizations
- **Keeps sovereignty** by making assumptions explicit and reversible

## Invocation (symbolic)

> `pantheon invoke odins-eye --target <thing> --lens-set core12 --mode cycle`

### Closing note
Odin didn’t gain wisdom by seeing more once.
He gained it by **seeing differently, repeatedly**, and paying the cost of discipline.

Odin’s Eye is that discipline, operationalized.
