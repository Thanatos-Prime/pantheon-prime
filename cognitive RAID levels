Perfect. Here’s a clean, publishable spec you can drop straight into a GitHub folder. This is written to be sober, defensible, and useful to engineers, operators, and researchers—no mystique required.

Cognitive RAID Levels (CR-0 → CR-5)

PantheonOS Extension Module

Overview

Cognitive RAID is a framework for designing fault-tolerant cognition by distributing memory, reasoning, and continuity across multiple layers—human and external—so that no single failure mode causes collapse.

The name is intentionally borrowed from computer storage:

Redundant Array of Independent Disks → Redundant Array of Independent Cognition

This is augmentation, not replacement of human judgment.

⸻

CR-0 — Biological Only (Baseline)

Description:
Unaided human cognition.

Components
	•	Biological memory
	•	Intuition
	•	Pattern recognition
	•	Emotional valuation

Strengths
	•	Fast
	•	Context-rich
	•	Value-aware

Failure Modes
	•	Stress degradation
	•	Memory distortion
	•	Fatigue
	•	Cognitive overload
	•	Single point of failure

Use Case
	•	Casual reasoning
	•	Low-stakes decisions
	•	Creative ideation without audit needs

⸻

CR-1 — External Artifacts (Static Offload)

Description:
Human cognition supported by static external memory.

Components
	•	Notes
	•	Documents
	•	Diagrams
	•	Checklists
	•	SOP cards

Strengths
	•	Reduces working memory load
	•	Improves recall under stress
	•	Portable

Failure Modes
	•	Artifacts can be outdated
	•	No active reasoning
	•	No consistency checking

Use Case
	•	Pilots, surgeons, operators
	•	Personal knowledge management

⸻

CR-2 — Schema-Based Rehydration

Description:
A compact schema can reconstruct a large conceptual system on demand.

Components
	•	Minimal seed (prompt/spec)
	•	Defined invariants
	•	Role grammar
	•	Reconstruction rules

Strengths
	•	Lossless compression
	•	Fast context restoration
	•	Survives resets and time gaps
	•	Outperforms biological recall under stress

Failure Modes
	•	Garbage-in → garbage-out

Use Case
	•	Long-running projects
	•	Architecture continuity
	•	Expert frameworks portable across tools

⸻

CR-3 — Assisted Reconstruction (Human + LLM)

Description:
Schema rehydration assisted by an LLM to expand, verify, and explore.

Components
	•	Human operator (values, intent)
	•	Rehydration schema
	•	LLM expansion engine
	•	Explicit truth hygiene (facts vs inference)

Strengths
	•	High-bandwidth reasoning
	•	Rapid synthesis
	•	Scenario exploration
	•	Stress resilience

Failure Modes
	•	Over-trust in outputs
	•	Drift without checks
	•	Requires explicit guardrails

Use Case

Multiple cognitive roles with verification, parity, and reason codes.

Components
	•	Hound (anomaly detection)
	•	Mirror (verification)
	•	Checksum (integrity)
	•	Ledger (decision trace)
	•	Degrade ladder

Strengths
	•	Detects internal contradictions
	•	Auditable decisions
	•	Drift-resistant
	•	Failure-tolerant reasoning

Failure Modes
	•	Slower
	•	Higher overhead
	•	Requires discipline

Use Case
	•	Safety-critical reasoning
	•	Governance frameworks
	•	Research and analysis
	•	Public-facing documentation

⸻

CR-5 — Distributed, Restartable Cognition

Description:
Fully restartable cognition where resets are expected and harmless.

Components
	•	Human biological memory
	•	Rehydration schema
	•	External artifacts (repos)
	•	LLM reconstruction
	•	Audit + invariants
	•	Explicit operator authority

Strengths
	•	No catastrophic forgetting
	•	Survives stress, time, tool loss
	•	Portable across people and platforms
	•	Continuity without persistence

Failure Modes
	•	Only human abdication
	•	Value confusion if operator role is unclear

Use Case
	•	Long-horizon projects
	•	Team handoffs
	•	Crisis leadership
	•	Legacy systems of thought

Core Principle (Put This in Bold in the Repo)

Values, intent, and responsibility always remain human.
The system reconstructs structure, not will.

This boundary is what keeps Cognitive RAID healthy.

⸻

Why this matters (one-line takeaway)

Cognitive RAID turns forgetting, stress, and resets from liabilities into non-events.

⸻

If you want next, I can:
	•	Map PantheonOS modules → CR levels
	•	Write a one-paragraph explainer for non-technical readers
	•	Add a Failure & Recovery Playbook per level
	•	Or generate diagrams you can include in the repo

This is solid enough to stand on its own.
