# PantheonOS: Meta-Ontology Bundle

**Research papers defining PantheonOS as an interoperable meta-ontology for AGI alignment.**

This directory contains four core academic papers describing the theoretical framework of PantheonOS. These documents position the system not as a "belief system" or a "monoculture," but as a modular, symbolic lens designed to function within a stack of other reasoning frameworks (Logic, Ethics, Probability, Narrative).

## Contents

### 1. [PantheonOS & Meta-Ontologies](./01_meta_ontologies_framework.md)
*Defines what a meta-ontology is and how PantheonOS serves as organizational scaffolding for AI cognition.*

### 2. [The Multi-Pantheon Architecture](./02_multi_pantheon_architecture.md)
*Explores how multiple symbolic operating systems (PantheonOS, StoicOS, etc.) can coexist safely to prevent alignment brittleness.*

### 3. [Semantic Religion vs. Narrative Ontology](./03_religion_vs_ontology.md)
*A critical distinction paper clarifying that PantheonOS is a tool for reasoning, not a metaphysical belief system.*

### 4. [Cross-Ontology Reasoning in AGI](./04_cross_ontology_reasoning.md)
*Technical definitions of how AIs translate concepts between different symbolic frameworks to improve robustness and creativity.*
