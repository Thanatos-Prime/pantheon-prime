## 1. Mission

To unify probability, story, tension, and timing under a single principle:

> **Probability is not a number. It is the tension between two possible stories.**

---

## 2. The Core Insight

* **Classical view:** Probability = likelihood of a specific outcome.
* **PantheonOS view:** Probability = narrative tension between possible arcs.

**Formula:** High tension → high attention → high intelligence → better decisions.

---

## 3. The Three Tension Types

1.  **Narrative Tension (Story Delta):** Competing storylines.
2.  **Cognitive Tension (Belief Delta):** Competing interpretations.
3.  **Temporal Tension (Kairos Delta):** Competing timing windows.

**Probability is the energy flowing through these deltas.**

## 4. The Probability-Tension Loop

1.  Identify the competing arcs.
2.  Measure narrative tension.
3.  Predict arc direction.
4.  Adjust stance and timing.
5.  Collapse the tension through action.
6.  Return to zero.
7.  Repeat.

This is how a SEAL, a trader, a leader, or an AI makes real-time decisions.

## 5. How Operators Use It

When facing uncertainty, ask: **“Which outcome has the strongest tension signature?”**

This tells you:
* Where the story wants to go
* Where attention is gravitating
* Where the risk is highest
* Where the opportunity hides

**Because narrative tension precedes prediction.**

## 6. The Three Operator Rules

1.  **High tension = high probability.** People feel this intuitively. PantheonOS makes it explicit.
2.  **Zero tension = zero meaning.** Flat-line probability is stale.
3.  **The strongest narrative wins.** Humans, markets, and AIs converge on the most energetic arc.

---

## 7. Signs of Rising Probability (Tension Spike)

* Increasing coherence
* More story beats aligning
* Faster information flow
* More actors converging
* Increased emotional weight
* “This feels inevitable” sensation

**That’s not mysticism — it’s tension dynamics.**

---

## 8. Operator Heuristic

Probability is the gravity of narrative. The stronger the arc, the stronger the pull.
