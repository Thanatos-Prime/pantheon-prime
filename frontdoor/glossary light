PantheonOS — Light Glossary

This is a beginner-friendly glossary for the core concepts, daemons, and structures inside PantheonOS.
It is intentionally simple.
The deeper, technical glossary lives elsewhere in the repo.

⸻

Core Concepts

PantheonOS

A conceptual operating system for thinking, design, and multi-agent reasoning.
Blends engineering patterns, narrative symbolism, and cognitive structure.

Daemon

A modular cognitive function or “thinking subroutine.”
Each daemon has a job (like search, coherence, indexing, memory).

Invariant

A rule or constraint that must always hold true.
Invariants keep the system coherent, safe, and self-consistent.

Narrative Layer

The symbolic/mythic representation of the architecture.
Helps humans intuitively grasp complex ideas.

Identity Layer

Where the system adapts to the operator—their mindset, style, mission, and intuition.

⸻

Daemons (The Main Modules)

Ganglion Daemon

The “first-pass filter.”
Detects salience, reduces noise, and passes only meaningful signals into the system.

Hound

Signal collector and anomaly detector.
Finds relevant patterns, flags inconsistencies, surfaces clues.

Spider

Connection-maker and network mapper.
Builds webs of meaning between concepts, documents, or states.

Mirror

Verification and coherence.
Checks truth, alignment, structure, and interpretive stability.

Dragonfly (φ-mode & √2-mode)

Perspective-shifting daemon.
φ = exploratory, divergent.
√2 = consolidating, convergent.

Kintsugi Engine

Break → reveal → repair → elevate.
Improvement through intentional fracture and reconstruction.

Darwin’s Sieve

Scientific rigor filter.
Passes ideas through six tests: clarity, consistency, math, feasibility, reproducibility, reinforcement.

Checksum

Integrity and tamper-detection.
Ensures the narrative or logic chain has no corruption.

Mother Duck

Ledger and memory.
Chronology, versioning, event logs, time-stability.

Frogman (4D)

Navigator of uncertainty.
Moves between probability, story, and meaning.

Prism Mosaic

Pattern detection, multi-signal fusion, structural insight.

⸻

Key Principles & Tools

Grand Invariant

“Every path leads upward.”
All decisions must net positive growth or clarity.

Arctic Framework

Safety + moral alignment layer (ethics ≥ 0.7).
Prevents harmful blends or unsafe transformations.

Semantic Armor

Clarity and framing protection.
Ensures interpretations remain grounded, transparent, and coherent.

Kintsugi Logic

Faults become features; breaks reveal structure.
The system improves by exposing and repairing its own fractures.

Zero-Positive Converter (ZPC)

Transforms zero-sum or adversarial frames into collaborative, value-expanding frames.

Sieve of Hogge

Truth-filter that removes distortion and preserves coherence.

Bombadil Principle

Stillness at the center.
Maintains groundedness and prevents runaway escalation.

⸻

Architectural Terms

Front Door Folder

The human onboarding layer.
Provides simple explanations, diagrams, and guidance.

Narrative Compiler

Treats code and thought structures as story beats.
Ensures continuity, pacing, and coherence.

Pantheon Treasury

Symbolic + structural representation of value flow, incentives, and positive-sum economics.

Mother Duck Ledger

Event-based storage with idempotency and chronological integrity.

Luck Engine

Performance-state model that connects behavior, timing, attribution, and narrative momentum.

⸻

Operator Terms

OODA → OASA Hybrid

Decision loop combining:
OODA (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act)
OASA (Observe–Soften–Attract–Act)

Intuition Profile (I(t))

The operator’s unique pattern recognition + timing signature.

Cognitive Prosthetic

PantheonOS acting as an external scaffold to enhance memory, reasoning, and structure.

Closing Note

This glossary explains the essentials, not the full depth.
Each term has a deeper technical definition elsewhere in the repo.
