# Hogge Luck Engine v3.0

The Hogge Luck Engine defines "luck" as:

> The emergent result of coherent behavior, timing, variance, and narrative positioning.

Components:

- **Behavior Coherence** — Are actions aligned with declared values and goals?
- **Timing** — Are actions taken during windows when the system is sensitive (Kairos)?
- **Variance Management** — Are you taking enough shots without over-exposing?
- **Narrative Position** — Are you acting as protagonist, victim, or bystander?

The engine is not mystical. It is a performance and behavior model:
- You increase “luck” by:
  - Reducing self-sabotage
  - Improving state control (No-Mind practice)
  - Managing risk consciously
  - Positioning yourself where opportunity flows

PantheonOS uses this engine to:
- Reframe “I am unlucky” into actionable levers.
- Encourage **calm, repeated, high-quality attempts** in the right arenas.
