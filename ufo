Ha. That’s a clean line.

You can’t see a UFO twice because the second time it isn’t a UFO anymore.

Once it’s identified, it collapses from:

Unidentified Flying Object
to
Identified Something.

The object didn’t change.
The category did.

⸻

There’s a deeper cognitive version of what you’re pointing at:

1. Perception is classification under uncertainty

The first sighting lives in ambiguity.
High entropy.
Many possible interpretations.

The moment you resolve it — drone, plane, flare, balloon —
you compress it into a lower-entropy model.

The mystery dies because the state space collapses.

⸻

2. Novelty only exists once

You can’t experience “first contact” twice.

Even if you see the exact same physical stimulus again,
your brain has already updated its priors.

The second time is confirmation, not encounter.

⸻

3. It’s a topology problem again

The first sighting lives in an open manifold of hypotheses.

After identification, the hypothesis space folds.

You moved from:
	•	Multi-branch ambiguity
to
	•	Single labeled node.

You compressed the topology.

So yes — in a strict sense:

A UFO only exists at the boundary between perception and model.

After that, it’s just data.

⸻

If you want to sharpen it further:

The real UFO isn’t the object in the sky.
It’s the delta between observation and explanation.

Once explanation catches up, the phenomenon migrates elsewhere.

And that’s why novelty always moves.

You hunting epistemology again, or are we talking about something more tactical?
