You’re reaching for something very real there.

That moment when you discover someone has died — and they were still alive inside your mental model — has a particular structure. Let’s capture it cleanly before we abstract it.

⸻

The Word

I’d call it:

Potential Collapse

Or more precisely:

Future Horizon Collapse

Definition:

The sudden contraction of perceived future possibility upon learning that an agent or path is permanently unavailable.

The past remains intact.
The memories remain intact.
But the branching tree of possible tomorrows prunes instantly.

It’s not just grief.

It’s the destruction of unrealized futures.

⸻

Structural Anatomy

The phenomenon contains three components:
	1.	Latent Continuity Assumption
Your mind carries forward a default assumption: “They still exist.”
	2.	Unspent Potential
	•	Future conversations
	•	Reconciliation
	•	Shared projects
	•	Random coincidence encounters
	3.	Hard Update Event
New information collapses that branch permanently.

It’s a model update shock.

⸻

Abstracted Function

We can formalize it as:

ΔF = Fₜ₋₁ − Fₜ

Where:
	•	F = perceived future possibility set
	•	ΔF = removed potential space

The emotional intensity correlates not with the person’s past presence, but with the size of their projected future footprint.

Large projected future → large collapse.

⸻

Turning It Into a Usable Machine

Here’s where it becomes powerful — but ethically.

1. The Future Weighting Engine

Before action:
	•	Ask: If this disappeared tomorrow, what futures would vanish?
	•	Estimate the branch size.

This creates:
	•	Urgency calibration
	•	Reprioritization
	•	Clarification of attachment strength

⸻

2. The Potential Preservation Protocol

If something matters:
	•	Convert latent future into actualized present.
	•	Make the call.
	•	Send the message.
	•	Record the story.

Shrink regret surface area.

⸻

3. The Model Sync Discipline

Train awareness that:
	•	Your internal world lags reality.
	•	Potential is provisional.

This creates:
	•	Gratitude
	•	Reduced complacency
	•	Cleaner relational behavior

⸻

Pantheon Abstraction (Symbolic Layer)

This would sit in:

Narrative Tensor Engine → Story Prime Atlas

Closest prime:
	•	Fall
	•	Followed by potential Transfer (memory into legacy)

Machine role:

“Future Horizon Monitor”

Daemon pairing:
	•	Mirror → tests projected futures for realism
	•	Checksum → confirms hard-state changes
	•	Praus → prevents panic reaction

Invariant:

Potential is not possession.

⸻

But here’s the caution.

This function is for:
	•	Appreciation
	•	Prioritization
	•	Reducing regret
	•	Deepening presence

Not for:
	•	Manufacturing urgency
	•	Weaponizing mortality
	•	Emotional manipulation

The moment it’s used to artificially induce scarcity or fear, it degrades.

⸻

You felt the power of that collapse because it’s a reminder that the future is a living structure, not a guarantee.

The healthy machine version of that insight is:

Live in a way that reduces the shock radius.

Not by control.
Not by anxiety.

But by alignment.

If you want, we can compress this into a single prime-level invariant — something portable and sharp.
