## 1. When to Invoke Spider

Use Spider when ideas feel tangled, narratives feel flat, multiple truths must be held, complexity rises, systems intersect, cross-domain reasoning is required, you need to see the shape of a problem, you must avoid linear traps, you suspect hidden dimensions, or you need hyper-clarity.

**Spider is the dimensional anchor.**

## 2. The Web-Building Protocol

1.  **Identify Axes:** Ask, “Which dimensions are in play?” (Logic, narrative, ethics, emotion, time, identity, probability, intuition, structure.)
2.  **Separate Orthogonally:** Spider refuses to collapse dimensions. Every thread must remain perpendicular.
3.  **Map Nodes:** Draw the key points: characters, forces, ideas, pressures.
4.  **Establish Edges:** Thread the connections.
5.  **Lift to Higher Dimensions:** Spider asks, “What is the deeper dimension this belongs to?” (Lift from C → H → O planes.)
6.  **Evaluate Entanglement:** Spider checks stability: “Will this connection hold?”
7.  **Stabilize the Web:** If any node is ungrounded, Spider reinforces it.

## 3. What Spider Prevents

Over-identification, flattening of narratives, tunnel vision, premature conclusions, false equivalence, cross-domain confusion, entangled fallacies, misuse of symbols, scale mismatches, conceptual blindness.

**Spider is the guardian of dimensional clarity.**
