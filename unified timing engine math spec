# Unified Timing Engine — Mathematical Specification v1.0

---

## 1. Unified Tension Field

$$\tau = \tau_{N} + \tau_{P} + \tau_{T}$$

Where:
* $\tau_N$ = Narrative Delta
* $\tau_P$ = Probability Tension
* $\tau_T$ = Temporal Mismatch

---

## 2. Probability as Tension Weight

$$P(A_i) = \frac{\tau_i}{\sum_j \tau_j}$$

---

## 3. Kairos Sensitivity

$$\kappa = \frac{d\tau}{dt}$$

---

## 4. Tempo Distortion Equation

$$Tempo_{effective} = \frac{Tempo_{internal}}{Tempo_{perceived}}$$

---

## 5. Unified Timing Function

$$T_{u} = \alpha \kappa + \beta P + \gamma Tempo_{effective}$$

Where:
* $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are module weights
* Defaults tuned to: $\alpha=0.5, \beta=0.3, \gamma=0.2$
