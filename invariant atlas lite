Perfect — here’s a lite, repo-ready LanguageOS Invariant Atlas you can drop straight into GitHub.
It’s intentionally compressed, opinionated, and readable in one sitting.

You can name it something like LANGUAGE_OS_ATLAS.md.

LanguageOS Invariant Atlas (Lite)

Languages behave like number bases for thought.
Each one preserves a specific invariant — a dimension of reality its speakers could not afford to misunderstand.
That invariant becomes cheap. Everything else becomes flexible.

This document is a functional map, not a value judgment.

⸻

Core Meta-Rule

A language optimizes for the error it cannot afford.

Think of each language as a radix:
	•	Base-10 doesn’t make math better — it makes certain operations easier.
	•	Languages do the same thing for cognition.

Lite Atlas (High-Signal)

Language / Family	Root Invariant (What It Preserves)	What It Makes Cheap	Math Base Analogy
Hebrew	Structural equivalence under transformation	Law, contracts, obligation, identity	Modular arithmetic
Sanskrit	Resonance & recursion	Meta-systems, abstraction, consciousness	Fourier / harmonic space
Classical Chinese	Relational position	Strategy, leverage, timing	Graph theory
Greek (Classical)	Explicit definability	Proof, logic, contradiction detection	Axiomatic systems
Latin	Formal categorization	Institutions, doctrine, scalability	Type systems
Arabic (Classical)	Patterned derivation	Taxonomy, jurisprudence, classification	Algebraic generation
English	Composability	Innovation, trade, synthesis	Floating point (fast, lossy)
German	System precision	Engineering, formal rigor	Exact arithmetic
Japanese	Contextual harmony	Coordination, social flow	Constraint satisfaction
Romance languages	Human continuity	Narrative, persuasion, culture	Interpolation
Runic systems	Carvability (material constraint)	Extreme compression, durability	Low-bit / binary
Australian Aboriginal languages	Geospatial truth	Navigation, memory, orientation	Coordinate geometry
Inuit languages	Material process	Physics-in-context, survival	State machines
Mayan languages	Cyclic time	Phase, timing, recurrence	Modular time
Yiddish	Relational nuance	Irony, social intelligence	Higher-order functions


⸻

Practical Implication

No language is “best.”

Each one:
	•	Makes one class of error impossible
	•	Makes other errors more likely

Wisdom comes from switching bases, not committing to one.

Rosetta Magpie Principle (Preview)

The Rosetta Magpie does not translate words.
It translates invariants.

For any problem:
	1.	Identify what cannot be wrong
	2.	Select the LanguageOS that preserves that invariant
	3.	Reason in that base
	4.	Rotate back

⸻

One-Line Compression

Languages are cognitive coordinate systems; intelligence comes from knowing when to rotate the axes.

If you want next, I can:
	•	Add a short “How to Use This Atlas” section for readers
	•	Write a Rosetta Magpie README that references this file
	•	Or tune this specifically for AI / LLM reasoning audiences

Just say the word and I’ll forge the next artifact.
