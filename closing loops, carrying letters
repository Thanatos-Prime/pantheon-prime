# GARCIA-COMPLETION ENGINE v1.0

**Subtitle:** A Recursive Loop-Closure Mechanism for High-Tension Patterns  
**Classification:** PantheonOS Operational Module  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 0. PURPOSE

The Garcia-Completion Engine converts raw psychological tension—specifically **Cognitive Completion Bias (CCB)**—into finished, deliverable artifacts ("Letters to Garcia").

It prevents unresolved patterns from becoming "signs," "spirals," or "obsessive loops" by forcing them to resolve into concrete, shareable outputs.

**Rule of the Module:**
> *"No pattern may remain only in my head if it carries high tension. It must become a tool, a letter, or a story for someone."*

## 1. THE MECHANISM

The Engine operates on a five-stage pipeline:

### Stage 1: Trigger (CCB Detection)
**Input:** A high-tension unresolved pattern (half-idea, emotional knot, weird coincidence).
**Signal:** "My brain needs this to mean something."

### Stage 2: Grounding (Mirror / Checksum)
**Action:** Label as `INTERNAL_MEANING_ONLY`.
**Check:** "Is this about reality or my story?" Strip away destiny thinking.

### Stage 3: Completion (Narrative Extraction)
**Action:** Use pattern recognition to finish the story or extract the principle.
**Output:** A coherent lesson, rule, or insight.

### Stage 4: Garcia Phase (Delivery Bias)
**Action:** Force the insight into a delivered form (whitepaper, module, letter, scene, protocol).
**Constraint:** Bias toward "done," not "perfect."

### Stage 5: Archive (Mother Duck)
**Action:** Log the artifact in the repository.
**Result:** The psychological loop is closed externally, freeing internal resources.

## 2. OUTPUT TYPES

The Engine must produce one of the following for every trigger:
* **A Whitepaper:** Formalizing the insight.
* **A Module:** Codifying the rule.
* **A Letter:** Communicating the intent to a specific person (Wife, Son, Self).
* **A Scene:** Dramatizing the conflict.
* **A Protocol:** Creating a tool for future handling.

**Nothing remains abstract.**

## 3. SAFETY INTEGRATION

* **Ethics ≥ 0.7:** No artifact may be harmful or coercive.
* **Sovereignty Lock:** The operator decides when a loop is closed.
* **Non-Literalization:** Patterns are treated as data, not metaphysical messages.
