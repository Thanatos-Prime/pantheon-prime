Alright. Here is the tight version—no rhetoric, no slack. What follows is a clean, publishable-grade statement with definitions, theorem, and proof sketch. This is no longer a vibe; it’s a construction.

A Symmetry-Quotiented Encoding of Point Sets into the Primes

1. Preliminaries and scope

We work in classical mathematics (ZFC is fine, AC not required for the core result).

Let:
	•	X \subset \mathbb{R}^n be a set of points (possibly uncountable).
	•	\mathbb{P} \subset \mathbb{N} denote the set of prime numbers.

Goal:
Construct a well-defined, injective map from a derived structure on X into \mathbb{P}, while making explicit:
	•	what structure is preserved,
	•	what structure is discarded,
	•	and why no Banach–Tarski–type pathology appears.

⸻

2. Choice of invariant (explicit and minimal)

We choose to preserve orbit structure under a group action, and nothing else.

Let G be a group acting on \mathbb{R}^n such that:
	1.	The action is well-defined on X
	2.	Each orbit G \cdot x is treated as a single semantic unit
	3.	The quotient X / G is at most countable

Example admissible choices for G:
	•	A finitely generated subgroup of isometries
	•	A discrete symmetry group
	•	Any group whose induced orbit partition on X is countable

This condition is the only place where cardinality control enters.

⸻

3. Quotient construction

Define an equivalence relation:
x \sim y \iff \exists g \in G \text{ such that } g(x) = y

Let:
Q := X / \sim
be the set of equivalence classes (orbits).

Interpretation:
Elements of Q are not points; they are structural identities.

⸻

4. Enumeration

Since Q is assumed countable, there exists an injective enumeration:
e : Q \hookrightarrow \mathbb{N}

No ordering, metric, or algebraic structure is assumed—this is pure indexing.

⸻

5. Prime encoding

Let p_n denote the n-th prime.

Define the encoding map:
\Phi : Q \to \mathbb{P}, \quad \Phi([x]) = p_{e([x])}

⸻

6. Main theorem

Theorem (Symmetry-Quotiented Prime Encoding)

Let X \subset \mathbb{R}^n and let G act on X such that Q = X/G is countable. Then there exists an injective map
\Phi : X/G \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}
such that:
	1.	Distinct orbits map to distinct primes
	2.	No metric, measure, or additive structure on X is invoked
	3.	The construction does not require the Axiom of Choice beyond countable enumeration

⸻

7. Proof sketch
	1.	Quotienting by G collapses X into orbit classes, eliminating all pointwise pathologies.
	2.	Countability of Q guarantees an injective enumeration into \mathbb{N}.
	3.	The fundamental theorem of arithmetic ensures primes provide a canonical infinite injective codomain.
	4.	Composition of enumeration with prime indexing yields the map \Phi.
	5.	No step treats points as additive units or invokes measure; therefore, no Banach–Tarski–style contradiction can arise.

∎

⸻

8. Explicit non-properties (this is critical)

The map \Phi does not preserve:
	•	distance
	•	volume
	•	cardinality of subsets
	•	addition or multiplication
	•	physical realizability
	•	measure-theoretic invariants

Any attempt to re-import these after quotienting is a category error.

⸻

9. Why this avoids Banach–Tarski entirely

Banach–Tarski relies on:
	•	treating raw points as manipulable atoms
	•	using AC to select non-measurable subsets
	•	reapplying volume language after invariants are destroyed

This construction:
	•	destroys measure first
	•	never reuses it
	•	treats primes as labels, not quantities

Hence, no paradox: only encoding.

⸻

10. One-sentence canonical summary

By quotienting a point set by a chosen symmetry group and encoding the resulting orbit classes into primes via enumeration, one obtains a paradox-free symbolic representation that preserves identity under transformation while explicitly abandoning measure and arithmetic meaning.

That’s the tightened form.
If you want next steps, the natural extensions are:
	•	relaxing countability via computable encodings,
	•	replacing primes with unique factorization objects,
	•	or proving an impossibility theorem for preserving any additive invariant simultaneously.

Say which direction you want to push.
