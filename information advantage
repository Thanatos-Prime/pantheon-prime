You’re circling a real shift — but the clean way to state it keeps us out of “new ruler class” mythology.

AI does flatten information advantage the way mass firearms flattened aristocratic combat advantage. Once knowledge and raw intelligence are cheap and ubiquitous, they stop being reliable separators.

But that doesn’t mean willpower replaces intelligence as the new supreme trait. That framing sneaks hierarchy back in through the side door.

What’s actually being selected for is subtler and more boring (which is how you know it’s real).

⸻

What’s ending (mostly)
	•	Information scarcity as power
	•	Credentialed intelligence as gatekeeping
	•	Knowing more facts as durable advantage
	•	Speed of recall as dominance

These were already eroding; AI just finished the job.

So yes: the infocracy / intelligentsia advantage collapses.

⸻

What doesn’t replace it (important)

Not:
	•	brute will
	•	dominance personalities
	•	sheer ambition
	•	“strong men”
	•	manifest destiny energy

Those spike briefly in transitions, then burn out fast.

History shows that when raw tools equalize, untempered will becomes a liability, not an advantage.

⸻

What actually gains weight now

The traits that scale with AI instead of against it:

1. Judgment

Knowing what not to do.
Knowing when not to act.
Knowing what matters when everything is available.

Judgment can’t be brute-forced.

⸻

2. Taste

Not aesthetic snobbery — selection under abundance.

When options explode, taste becomes the bottleneck:
	•	which problem is worth solving
	•	which signal is worth trusting
	•	which output is “good enough”

AI amplifies taste; it doesn’t replace it.

⸻

3. Agency discipline

Not willpower in the macho sense, but:
	•	follow-through
	•	restraint
	•	finishing
	•	maintenance
	•	returning after boredom

This is quiet, unglamorous, and decisive.

⸻

4. Embodiment

Physical presence, coordination, care, repair, leadership, trust.

Anything that:
	•	involves bodies
	•	involves risk
	•	involves accountability
	•	involves humans looking at each other

AI can assist here, but not substitute.

⸻

5. Responsibility

When intelligence is cheap, liability becomes expensive.

People who can:
	•	be blamed,
	•	be trusted,
	•	hold consequences,
	•	absorb error without deflecting,

suddenly matter a lot more.

⸻

The real shift (compressed)

AI doesn’t crown a new elite.
It removes excuses.

You can no longer say:
	•	“I didn’t know”
	•	“I lacked access”
	•	“I wasn’t smart enough”

What remains is:
	•	choice
	•	care
	•	timing
	•	responsibility

That’s not dominance.
That’s adulthood.

⸻

The mistake to avoid

Every transition tempts people to say:

“Now this trait will rule.”

That’s always wrong.

What actually happens is multipolar weighting:
	•	fewer single kings
	•	more context-specific competence
	•	faster rise and faster decay

Power becomes more situational, not absolute.

⸻

The sober ending (fits Pantheon common sense)

AI equalizes cognition the way infrastructure equalizes terrain.

After that, what matters is not who thinks hardest —
but who:
	•	notices,
	•	chooses well,
	•	acts cleanly,
	•	and lives with the consequences.

No chosen class.
No supreme trait.

Just fewer hiding places.

That’s not the end of hierarchy —
it’s the end of pretending intelligence alone earned it.
