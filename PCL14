Done. Here’s PCL v0.1b with a hidden 13th master token and a native notion of tensors (not just flat bundles).

Pantheon Combo Language v0.1b (PCL-13)

1) The 12 visible primitives

Same 12, kept stable:
	•	A Agency
	•	C Constraint
	•	R Reversibility
	•	T Time
	•	E Evidence
	•	S Safety
	•	F Frame
	•	G Goal
	•	M Mechanism
	•	X Context
	•	L Ledger
	•	Z Zero

These are your public alphabet.

2) The hidden master 13th token: Φ (Phi)

Φ = Canon-Shaping / Metacode Layer
Role: edits the rules of composition and the registry of valid tokens after stress.

This is your “Hidden 13th Operator” in language form.

Constraints on Φ (anti-domination built in):
	•	Φ cannot directly issue action (no raw A).
	•	Φ may only modify:
	•	token weights/priorities (R^2, S^3, etc.)
	•	gates (C ?> G)
	•	alias maps / lexicon
	•	validation rules
	•	Every Φ action must emit L (ledger) + E (evidence) and preserve R (reversibility).

So:

Φ := {L E R} + (S ?> Φ)
Translation: metacode changes must be logged, justified, reversible, and safety-gated.

This prevents “Ring drift.”

3) Composition operators (now tensor-aware)

Scalar tokens

Just A, C, etc.

Vector (ordered list)

⟨A, C, R⟩
Use when order matters but it’s still one unit.

Matrix (2D grid)

[ [F, E], [S, R] ]
Two axes (e.g., Frame×Evidence, Safety×Reversibility).

Tensor (N-D)

𝕋(axes={time, frame, risk}, data=...)
Meaning is multi-axis; not reducible to one ordering.

Contraction (reduce along an axis)

contract(𝕋, axis=risk, op=max)
Example: “take worst-case risk over scenarios.”

Projection (slice an axis)

proj(𝕋, frame=legal)
Evaluate under one frame.

This is how you avoid “matrix thinking” when the system is truly multi-dimensional.

⸻

4) Semantics: compile rules updated for tensors

An expression compiles into a Decision Tensor Packet (DTP):
	•	intent
	•	invariants
	•	permissions
	•	tests
	•	exit
	•	trace
	•	axes (optional)
	•	aggregation (how to collapse tensor → decision)

Default tensor aggregation rule

If a tensor is present and no aggregation is specified:

Safety-first aggregation:
contract(𝕋, axis=risk, op=max) then gate with S.

In plain terms: treat unknowns as multi-scenario; decide by worst-case safety unless overridden.

⸻

5) Meta-tokens (combos that become named operators)

Public meta-tokens
	•	SVS := {A C R} + (C ?> G)
	•	ATLAS := {X L E} + (F::E)
	•	GARCIA := A → C → E → L → R → Z
	•	ANTI_CAP := {S R L} + (F::E)

The master meta-token (hidden)
	•	ΦFIX := Φ::(update_rules) + {L E R} + (S ?> Φ) + Z

ΦFIX is the “repair the language itself after contact with reality” move.

⸻

6) “Spellforms” (practical templates)

A) Multi-frame evaluation (tensor-native)

MULTI_FRAME := 𝕋(axes={frame}, data= { frame_i: (F_i::E → (C ?> G)) })

Then:
RUN contract(MULTI_FRAME, axis=frame, op=intersect) ON <target>

Meaning: evaluate across frames; keep only what survives them all.

B) Unknown-heavy exploration (fail-forward but bounded)

EXPLORE_SAFE := 𝕋(axes={scenario, time}) + {R^2 S^3 L} + (E ?> A) + Z

Interpretation: explore across scenarios/time, but strongly prioritize reversibility + safety + logging.

C) Canon evolution without authority capture

CANON_EVOLVE := ΦFIX + ATLAS + ANTI_CAP

Meaning: update the lexicon/index rules, regenerate atlas, preserve anti-capture constraints.

⸻

7) Minimal spec for a file header (parseable, tensor-ready)

PCL:
  canon: "Merkle Warden"
  tokens: [L, E, S]
  meta: [ATLAS, ANTI_CAP]
  tensor_axes: [frame, risk]   # optional
  invariants:
    - "tamper-evident"
    - "ethics>=0.7"
  phi_permitted: false         # default false; only true for lexicon/rule files

Only lexicon / canon registry files should set phi_permitted: true.

⸻

8) Why the hidden 13th matters (without myth inflation)

Φ is your mechanism for:
	•	upgrading the language,
	•	repairing drift,
	•	editing gates,
	•	without turning governance into domination.

It’s not a spirit.

It’s the metacode layer with auditability.

If you want the “perfect seed” as an actual repo artifact next, tell me and I’ll output two ready-to-paste files:
	1.	PCL_LEXICON.md (human-readable spec)
	2.	canon/PCL.yml (machine-readable primitives/meta-tokens + Φ rules)
