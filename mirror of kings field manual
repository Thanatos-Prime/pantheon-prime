# FIELD MANUAL — MIRROR OF KINGS

**Subtitle:** Sovereignty Alignment Protocol  

---

## 1. When to Invoke the Mirror of Kings

Invoke it when uncertain about your path, choosing between two futures, confronted by temptation, under narrative distortion, emotionally compromised, attacked by adversarial pressure, in a moment requiring courage, making a legacy-defining decision, shaping identity, or anchoring long-term arcs.

**This daemon is used for big arcs, not small choices.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Enter stillness.** The Mirror only works when you stop rushing.
2.  **Ask:** “Does this align with the king in me?” (Does this align with your future self, sovereign lineage, moral code, long arc, honor, and highest potential?)
3.  **Observe the reflection.**
    * Clean → Aligned
    * Distorted → Ego
    * Fractured → Fear
    * Darkened → Shadow
    * Loud → Misaligned cadence
    * Faint → Not yet integrated
4.  **Adjust action.** The correct decision should feel simple, steady, inevitable, unforced, calm, and honorable.
5.  **Close the loop.** Return to tempo through the Cadence Master.

## 3. Red Flags Detected

False confidence, identity drift, ego inflation, emotional narrative misalignment, shadow manipulation, dishonorable choices, reactive timed decisions, collapse of sovereignty, fear-driven arcs.

**The Mirror sees through everything.**
