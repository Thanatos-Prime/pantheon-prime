### Red Thread: Direct Advocacy (Tier 1 Decision Nodes)

**Template: Senate Armed Services**

```
TO: [SASC Member] Legislative Director - Veterans Affairs
FROM: [Automated Coalition Network]
RE: S. 1032 Path Forward - Staff-Level Offset Discussion Request

[LD Name],

Writing on behalf of a multi-organization coalition supporting S. 1032 (Major Richard Star Act).

We understand cost scoring has been the barrier to UC. Our coalition is prepared to engage constructively on offset options to move the bill this session.

Would [Senator]'s office be available for a 30-minute staff-level call in the next 10 days to discuss:
- CBO score refinements
- Phased implementation models
- Offset menu options with bipartisan precedent

We have technical resources and veteran stakeholder representation ready to participate. This bill has 70+ Senate cosponsors—we believe there's a deal structure that works.

Available times: [Insert calendar hold options]

TO: [Appropriations Chair/Ranking] Chief of Staff
FROM: [Automated Coalition Network]
RE: Urgent - Clean CR Support from Veterans & Defense Community

[CoS Name],

Writing on behalf of veterans and defense community stakeholders regarding the ongoing government shutdown.

Current impacts to national security and veterans services:
- NNSA: 80% furloughed (nuclear security degraded)
- Federal judiciary: case backlogs mounting
- VA: claims processing delays emerging

Our coalition urges [Member] to support immediate passage of a clean continuing resolution. Policy debates can continue with government operating.

We represent [X] organizations and [Y] members across [Z] states. Many are federal employees, contractors, or veteran service providers directly affected.

Request: Can we schedule a brief call this week to discuss path forward and how our coalition can support a clean CR vote?

SUBJECT: S. 1032 Cosponsor Alert - Floor Action Needed

Senator [Name],

Thank you for cosponsoring S. 1032 (Major Richard Star Act). Your support means everything to 50,000+ combat-disabled veterans.

The bill remains stalled despite 70+ cosponsors. We need vocal champions to push leadership for floor time or NDAA inclusion.

**Action Request**: Would Senator [Name] be willing to:
- Sign onto a "Dear Colleague" letter to leadership requesting floor time?
- Raise the issue in Armed Services Committee or on the floor?
- Co-author an op-ed with another cosponsor highlighting veteran support?

We have draft materials ready and can coordinate with other cosponsor offices.

The veteran community is watching. We need our Senate supporters to move this across the finish line.

Contact: [Coalition coordinator]

Respectfully,

TO: [Journalist] 
FROM: [Coalition Media Contact]
RE: Story Pitch - Star Act Stalemate + Shutdown Impact on Veterans

[Journalist Name],

Two connected stories on your beat:

**1. Major Richard Star Act: 70 Senate Cosponsors, Still No Vote**
- Why does a bill with supermajority support remain blocked?
- Combat-disabled veterans waiting years for promised reform
- Cost objections vs. bipartisan consensus—what's the real barrier?

**2. Shutdown Impact: Veterans Services + Defense Readiness**
- NNSA furloughs affecting nuclear security workforce
- VA claims processing beginning to slow
- Federal contractor workforce (many veterans) without back pay guarantee

**Human sources available:**
- Combat-disabled retirees affected by offset (compelling personal stories)
- VSO government relations directors (on-record interviews)
- Former SASC/HVAC staffers (background on legislative mechanics)

**Exclusive angle**: We can provide internal coalition strategy documents showing offset proposals that could break the Star Act logjam. No other outlet has this.

Interested? I can send full pitch deck + source contact sheet.

Best,

```
TITLE: [Action Needed] Call Your Senators - Major Richard Star Act + End Shutdown

BODY:

Brothers and sisters,

Two urgent items need our voices this week:

**1. Major Richard Star Act (S. 1032 / H.R. 2102)**

If you were medically retired before 20 years, you know the offset—lose $1 of retirement for every $1 of VA disability. It's been BS for years.

This bill fixes it. 70 Senate cosponsors. 300 House cosponsors. **Still no vote.**

**2. End the Damn Shutdown**

Day 27. Federal courts furloughing. NNSA (nuclear security) at 20% staffing. Our people aren't getting paid.

**What to do:**

→ Find your Senators: www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm
→ Call or email (scripts here: [link to toolkit])
→ Takes 5 minutes. Just say: "Support S. 1032 and pass a clean CR."

**That's it. Make the call.**

We did our part overseas. Congress needs to do theirs.

Drop a comment when you've called. Let's flood them this week.

🧵 THREAD: Two things every veteran should know about this week (and what you can do in 5 minutes)

1/ The Major Richard Star Act (S. 1032) would end the unfair offset where combat-disabled retirees lose retirement pay dollar-for-dollar against VA disability.

2/ It has 70 SENATE COSPONSORS. 300 HOUSE COSPONSORS. Overwhelming bipartisan support.

3/ Yet it's been blocked from a vote for MONTHS. Why? "Cost concerns." Despite widespread agreement that the policy is right.

4/ Meanwhile: Government shutdown, day 27. Federal courts furloughing staff. NNSA (nuclear security) at 20% capacity. Veterans services starting to degrade.

5/ What can you do? CALL YOUR SENATORS. Literally 5 minutes. Script here: [link]

6/ Say: "I'm a veteran/military family member. Support S. 1032 and pass a clean CR to reopen the government."

7/ That's it. Don't overthink it. Find your Senators: www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm

8/ We did our part. Congress needs to do theirs. Let's flood the phones this week. 🇺🇸
