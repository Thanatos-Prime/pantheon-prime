# Time Stack & Zero-Timing

PantheonOS uses a **three-layer time model**:

1. **Chronos** — clock time, deadlines, calendar dates.
2. **Kairos** — windows of heightened system sensitivity (Kairos Windows).
3. **Narrative Time** — act structure, beats, arcs, “phases” of a story.

**Zero-Timing (Hogge Zero)** adds:

- A concept of **T=0** — the moment of stillness, reset, or Bombadil-state.
- Used as:
  - A way to exit feedback loops.
  - A way to drop cortisol and regain perspective.
  - A way to “blink slower than time” before acting.

In practice:
- PantheonOS does not predict the future.
- It helps users:
  - Recognize when *not* to act.
  - Identify windows where a small push has outsized effect.
  - Avoid time-blind decisions that create avoidable regret.
