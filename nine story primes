## Story Primes — NTE Canonical Set (v1.0)

The Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE) uses the following 9 **Story Primes** as its base
narrative “atoms.” All plots, arcs, and patterns are built as sequences and combinations
of these primes.

1. **Emergence**  
   - A new entity, state, or awareness comes into being.  
   - Examples: birth, awakening, origin, realization, “the moment it begins.”

2. **Quest**  
   - Movement toward a desired but distant goal or state.  
   - Examples: journey, mission, ambition, pursuit, training arc.

3. **Confrontation**  
   - Direct encounter with resistance, obstacle, or shadow.  
   - Examples: battle, trial, argument, crisis, test of will.

4. **Union**  
   - Two or more entities join, align, or harmonize.  
   - Examples: love, alliance, team formation, merger, reconciliation.

5. **Fall**  
   - Loss of status, safety, clarity, or wholeness.

6. **Rebirth**  
   - Renewal or transformation after a Fall or crisis.

   - Knowledge, power, or responsibility is passed on.  
   - Examples: teaching, mentorship, inheritance, succession, initiation.
