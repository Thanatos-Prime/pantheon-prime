## 1. Introduction

Modern AI systems suffer from *temporal drift*:

- context shifts,
- narrative threads warp,
- multiple agents disagree about "where" they are in the story,
- and decision modules operate on subtly different notions of "now".

We propose the **Time Gyroscope (TG-1)**: a temporal stability engine
for PantheonOS that maintains a three-axis notion of "time":

1. **Chronos** — linear, monotonically increasing physical time.
2. **Phase** — narrative/complex time, modeled as an angle.
3. **Kairos** — moment-sensitivity (how "thick" the current moment is).

TG-1 does not predict the future and does not schedule actions.
Instead, it ensures that *all other modules* in PantheonOS operate
against a coherent, smoothed, and drift-resistant temporal frame.

## 2. Conceptual Model

### 2.1 Chronos Axis (Sisyphus)

Chronos is represented by:

- a monotonic **tick counter** `tick ∈ ℕ`,
- a wall-clock timestamp `t_chronos ∈ ℝ`.

This axis corresponds to Sisyphus in the Pantheon:

> step after step, never backward, never skipped.

It guarantees ordering and prevents temporal paradox
at the implementation layer.

---

### 2.2 Phase Axis (Narrative Complex Time)

We define a **narrative phase angle**:

\[
\phi_t \in [0, 2\pi)
\]

which tracks "where we are" in a narrative or systemic beat cycle.

Higher **event_rate** and **kairos** accelerate phase rotation:

\[
\dot{\phi}_t = v(\text{event\_rate}_t, \text{kairos}_t)
\]

so that high-intensity periods advance the "story clock" faster
than calm periods.

Mathematically, this is a complex-plane representation of time:

\[
z_t = t_{\text{chronos}} + i \phi_t
\]

where the imaginary component encodes narrative progression.

---

### 2.3 Kairos Axis (Praus)

Kairos is modeled as a scalar:

\[
k_t \in [0, 1]
\]

representing temporal *sensitivity*:

- low \( k_t \): time feels loose, low consequence, low volatility.
- high \( k_t \): time feels dense, high consequence, high volatility.

Praus corresponds to the damping and steering of Kairos:

> "Move slowly through heavy time; keep the vessel steady."

TG-1 updates `k_t` with simple exponential smoothing toward an
observed tension signal.

---

## 3. Mathematical Definition

Let:

- \( \tau_t \) = observed tension at time \( t \), \( \tau_t \in [0, 1] \)
- \( r_t \) = event rate (≥ 0)
- \( \Delta t = t_{\text{now}} - t_{\text{last}} \)

### 3.1 Kairos Update

We define a target Kairos:

\[
k^*_t = \frac{k_{\text{base}} + \tau_t}{2}
\]

and update via exponential smoothing:

\[
k_t = \alpha_k k_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha_k) k^*_t
\]

### 3.2 Phase Update

Define a phase velocity:

\[
\omega_t = (1 + r_t) (0.5 + k_t)
\]

Phase increment:

\[
\Delta \phi = \omega_t \Delta t
\]

Raw phase:

\[
\phi'_t = \phi_{t-1} + \Delta \phi
\]

wrapped into \([0, 2\pi)\) and smoothed to avoid jitter:

\[
\phi_t = \text{SmoothAngle}(\phi_{t-1}, \text{Wrap}(\phi'_t))
\]

### 3.3 Stability

Define instability:

\[
u_t = \max\left(\tau_t, \min\left(\frac{r_t}{10}, 1\right)\right)
\]

and stability:

\[
s^*_t = 1 - u_t
\]
\[
s_t = \alpha_s s_{t-1} + (1 - \alpha_s) s^*_t
\]

where \( s_t \in [0, 1] \) is the **Temporal Stability Index**.

## 4. Implementation Summary

The reference implementation lives in:

- `engine/time_gyroscope.py`
- `TimeGyroscope` class
- `TimeState` dataclass

Core method:

```python
state = tg.update(
    observed_tension=τ_t,
    event_rate=r_t,
    now=t_now,
)
