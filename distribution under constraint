You’re basically right—and the interesting part is why that statement is true only after you widen the frame a bit.

Here’s the tightened version.

⸻

1. Non-emergence usually means no net selection pressure

If a trait does not reliably appear or stabilize in a population, the simplest explanations are:
	•	it confers no consistent fitness advantage
	•	it imposes a cost that outweighs its benefit
	•	it only helps in rare or unstable environments
	•	it’s neutral and lost to drift

Natural selection is not sentimental.
Traits don’t persist because they’re interesting, moral, or meaningful—only because, on average, they don’t get erased.

⸻

2. But “selected for” ≠ “kept forever”

This is the nuance you’re gesturing at.

A trait can be:
	•	selected for in one regime
	•	neutral or costly in another
	•	actively selected against later

Evolution optimizes locally, not globally.

So traits disappear when:
	•	environments change
	•	constraints shift
	•	tradeoffs accumulate
	•	other traits supersede their function more cheaply

Efficiency matters. Biology prefers good enough with low overhead.

3. Traits don’t have to vanish to stop being primary

Many traits don’t disappear—they get downgraded.

They become:
	•	latent
	•	conditional
	•	context-activated
	•	secondary
	•	niche-dependent

Think:
	•	sickle cell trait
	•	lactose tolerance
	•	stress hypervigilance
	•	novelty-seeking
	•	dominance displays
	•	certain sexual or social behaviors

They’re not “errors.”
They’re tools that no longer fit the main job.

⸻

4. Population-level invisibility ≠ individual uselessness

This is where people get confused.

A trait may:
	•	not scale well at population level
	•	but be highly adaptive for certain individuals
	•	or in certain niches
	•	or under rare but critical conditions

Evolution does not optimize fairness.
It optimizes distribution under constraint.

So some traits survive as:
	•	polymorphisms
	•	minority strategies
	•	edge-case specialists

They’re real—but they don’t dominate.

⸻

5. Suppression can mimic non-selection

Important caveat:

Sometimes traits don’t emerge not because biology rejected them, but because culture suppressed their expression.

That creates:
	•	hidden variance
	•	underground phenotypes
	•	delayed or distorted expression

When conditions change, those traits can suddenly surface—often clumsily—because they weren’t refined in the open.

This is true for:
	•	cognition
	•	sexuality
	•	temperament
	•	creativity
	•	leadership styles

Silence doesn’t mean absence.
It sometimes means containment.

⸻

6. The deep rule (cleanly stated)

A trait persists if and only if:

its average benefit exceeds its cost within the constraints of its environment

When that inequality flips, the trait:
	•	fades
	•	fragments
	•	becomes conditional
	•	or migrates into a different domain (behavioral, cultural, symbolic)

That’s not failure.
That’s adaptation to new constraints.

⸻

7. One sentence version

If a trait doesn’t show up at scale, either nature didn’t reward it—or it did once, and the bill eventually came due.

That logic applies cleanly to biology, psychology, culture, and even institutions.

You’re thinking in the right register.
