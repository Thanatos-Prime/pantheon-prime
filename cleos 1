Perfect, let’s forge this into something you could actually spec, pitch, and eventually ship.

I’ll treat this as a real product:

A software add-on that reads preexisting data from Oura / Whoop / similar wearables and runs our Closed-Loop Emotional Optimization System (CLEOS) on top.

I’ll break it into:
	1.	Core Product Definition
	2.	High-Level Architecture
	3.	Data Ingestion from Oura / Whoop (Add-On Model)
	4.	Processing & Modeling Layer (The “Emotional Engine”)
	5.	Output / Feedback Channels
	6.	Technical Stack Suggestions
	7.	Security, Privacy, and API Permission Model

You can hand this to an engineer and they’ll know where to start.

⸻

1. Core Product Definition

Product name (placeholder): CLEOS-Link

Goal:
Attach to existing wearable ecosystems (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch, etc.), read live and historical biometric data, merge it with user context (calendar, app usage, simple self-reports), and run our emotional state engine + feedback loops without needing to build new hardware.

Design principle:

“We don’t replace the wearable; we interpret and orchestrate it.”

CLEOS-Link is:
	•	a cloud + mobile + optional desktop solution,
	•	that uses OAuth to connect to existing wearable accounts,
	•	periodically pulls or streams data,
	•	builds an emotional state model, and
	•	delivers feedback through phone haptics, notifications, audio, and (later) optional smart-rings/bands.

⸻

2. High-Level Architecture

Think in 5 layers:
	1.	Client Layer
	•	Mobile app (iOS/Android)
	•	Web dashboard (optional)
	•	Browser extension (future)
	2.	Integration Layer
	•	API connectors for:
	•	Oura
	•	Whoop
	•	Apple Health / Google Fit
	•	(Later) Garmin, Fitbit, etc.
	3.	Data Platform Layer
	•	Ingestion pipeline (streaming + batch)
	•	Time-series database
	•	Feature store (HRV metrics, emotional features, context features)
	4.	Emotional Engine Layer
	•	State estimation models
	•	Drift detection
	•	Personalization engine
	•	Policy + intervention decision logic
	5.	Feedback Layer
	•	Push notifications
	•	Mobile haptics
	•	Audio cues / short “regulation scripts”
	•	App UI visualizations
	•	(Later) API for 3rd-party apps to hook into emotional state

3. Add-On Model: Reading Data from Oura / Whoop

3.1 Integration Pattern

We build CLEOS as an OAuth client that connects to user accounts on other platforms.

User flow:
	1.	User installs CLEOS app.
	2.	Taps “Connect Oura” or “Connect Whoop”.
	3.	Redirects to Oura/Whoop login via OAuth.
	4.	User grants permissions (read sleep, HR, HRV, activity, etc.).
	5.	CLEOS receives:
	•	an access token (limited-duration),
	•	a refresh token (to keep access alive),
	•	and a scopes list (what data we’re allowed to read).

We never ask for write permissions to their wearable data. Only read.

⸻

3.2 What Data We’d Actually Pull

From platforms like Oura / Whoop, we typically can access (via their APIs):
	•	Heart Rate Data
	•	Instantaneous HR
	•	HRV (RMSSD, LF/HF etc. if exposed or derivable)
	•	Nightly averages, distribution
	•	Sleep Data
	•	Bedtime & wake time
	•	Sleep stages (deep/REM/light/awake)
	•	Sleep quality scores
	•	Sleep latency
	•	Restlessness / movement
	•	Activity Data
	•	Step count
	•	Calories burned
	•	Activity intensity / zones
	•	Workout sessions
	•	Recovery / Readiness
	•	Readiness scores
	•	Strain / load scores
	•	Rest days vs intense days

These signals feed directly into our emotional models:
	•	Sleep debt → emotional volatility risk
	•	High strain + low recovery → irritability / burnout risk
	•	High HRV baseline → resilience and regulation capacity

⸻

3.3 Ingestion Cadence

We define schedules:
	•	Nightly batch ingestion
	•	Pull previous day’s sleep, readiness, strain, etc.
	•	Frequent mini-sync (e.g., every 5–15 min)
	•	Pull more recent HR/HRV/activity (where API and rate limits allow).
	•	On-demand sync
	•	When user opens the app, force a fast refresh.

We respect each vendor’s rate limits and tokens renewal rules.

4. Processing & Modeling Layer (The Emotional Engine)

This is our core IP.

4.1 Data Model

Each user has a time-indexed feature set, e.g.:
	•	t = timestamp
	•	Raw features:
	•	hr[t], hrv_rmssd[t], hrv_lf_hf[t]
	•	steps[t], activity_intensity[t]
	•	sleep_score[day], sleep_debt[day]
	•	temp_deviation[t] (if available)
	•	Derived features:
	•	stress_index[t]
	•	fatigue_score[t]
	•	irritability_risk[t]
	•	focus_resource[t]

We store this in a time-series database (e.g., TimescaleDB, InfluxDB) plus a persistent user profile table.

⸻

4.2 Emotional State Estimation

We can model emotional state as a vector in a continuous space, e.g.:

E(t) = [Arousal(t), Valence(t), Stability(t), Volatility(t), Fatigue(t), Resilience(t)]

Where:
	•	Arousal ≈ sympathetic activation (from HR, HRV, EDA where available)
	•	Valence ≈ positive vs negative tone (partially inferred from user annotations / context)
	•	Stability ≈ how fast E(t) changes
	•	Volatility ≈ variance of emotional features over recent window
	•	Fatigue ≈ function of sleep, load, time awake
	•	Resilience ≈ trait-like HRV baseline + recent trend

Under the hood:
	•	Use Bayesian filters or Kalman filters to smooth and update E(t).
	•	Use ML models (gradient boosted trees / small neural nets) trained to map physiological features → emotional likelihood distribution (for early versions, we can rely on heuristics + simple models).
	•	Adjust models over time using self-report check-ins from users (“How do you feel right now?” slider/tags) to fine-tune.

⸻

4.3 Drift Detection

We define thresholds:
	•	If Arousal(t) spikes + Valence(t) trending negative → stress onset detected
	•	If Fatigue(t) high + Arousal(t) low → risk of brain fog / low motivation
	•	If Volatility(t) high over several hours → risk of emotional instability

We implement:
	•	Sliding windows (e.g., last 5/15/60 minutes)
	•	Change-point detection algorithms
	•	Notification triggers when emotional drift crosses personalized thresholds.

⸻

5. Output / Feedback Channels

Since we’re piggybacking on Oura/Whoop, our primary output device is the phone (initially).

5.1 Core Output Modalities
	1.	Haptic Patterns
	•	Gentle double-tap → “Take a breath”
	•	Slow wave vibration → “Match your breath to this pattern”
	•	Short burst → “You’re entering a known stress window; consider a 1-min reset”
	2.	Micro-Interventions in the App
	•	30–60 sec guided breath patterns
	•	Quick grounding exercises
	•	Short reframes: “You’re low-sleep + high load; be extra kind to yourself today.”
	3.	Contextual Notifications
	•	“You usually snap in meetings at this fatigue + strain combo. Today is high risk; want a pre-meeting reset?”
	•	“Your HRV is unusually low and sleep debt high. Suggest light workload and boundaries.”
	4.	Longer-Horizon Insights
	•	Weekly emotional volatility graph
	•	“You get most irritable when:
	•	sleep < 6h
	•	strain > 14
	•	and you have meetings after 3 p.m.”

We can later add:
	•	Smartwatch app for direct haptics
	•	Audio cues via AirPods / headphones
	•	An SDK so other apps can consume “Emotional State API” and adapt content.

6. Suggested Tech Stack

6.1 Client
	•	iOS app (Swift / SwiftUI)
	•	Android app (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose)
	•	Optional React Native / Flutter to share codebase.

Features: OAuth flows, local storage, basic UI, push notifications, simple local visualizations.

⸻

6.2 Backend
	•	API Layer:
	•	Node.js (NestJS) or Python (FastAPI) or Go — your choice.
	•	Auth & User Management:
	•	JWT for sessions; Cognito/Auth0 or custom.
	•	Database:
	•	Postgres (user profiles + config)
	•	TimescaleDB (time-series features) or InfluxDB.
	•	Background Jobs / Scheduler:
	•	Celery / RQ (Python) or BullMQ (Node) for periodic data syncs.
	•	Model Serving:
	•	Python ML stack (scikit-learn / PyTorch Light / XGBoost) behind FastAPI endpoints or a separate microservice.

⸻

6.3 Integrations

Each vendor gets a small dedicated module:
	•	oura_client.py
	•	Handles OAuth tokens
	•	Wraps Oura’s REST API calls
	•	Provides standardized data: get_sleep_data(), get_hr_data(), etc.
	•	whoop_client.py
	•	apple_health_bridge (likely via HealthKit integration on device side, then sync to backend)
	•	google_fit_client.py

Each normalizes into a common schema so the Emotional Engine doesn’t care which wearable the data came from.

⸻

7. Security, Privacy, and Permissions

Because this is nuclear-grade sensitive, we design with serious boundaries:
	•	Only read access to wearable data (never write/modify).
	•	All data encrypted:
	•	In transit: HTTPS/TLS
	•	At rest: disk-level + per-user encryption where feasible.
	•	User controls:
	•	Clear toggle to delete all data
	•	Option to export their emotional history as a file
	•	Explicit choice to opt-in to any research/aggregated analysis.
	•	No selling personal emotional data by default.
If there’s any B2B model later, it should be:
	•	Aggregated, anonymized
	•	With strong differential privacy techniques
	•	Clear contractual + moral boundaries.

You could, however, build:
	•	A premium B2B analytics layer that only uses highly aggregated, non-identifiable patterns (e.g., “80% of 30–35yo male users experience X at 3 p.m. after Y”).

⸻

Short Narrative Summary (for your head & pitch deck)

CLEOS-Link is a software layer that attaches to Oura, Whoop, and other wearables via OAuth. It reads their existing biometric streams (HRV, sleep, activity), merges them with context (calendar, usage patterns), and runs an emotional state model that predicts stress, volatility, and focus in real time.

Rather than being another tracker, it’s the Emotional OS that interprets all those signals and gives the user targeted micro-interventions: haptic cues, regulatory prompts, and weekly insights.

No new hardware required. Just a better brain for the data that already exists.

If you want, next I can:
	•	turn this into a GitHub repo structure (folders, README, initial stubs),
	•	write a 1-pager for investors, or
	•	draft the API spec for /connect/oura, /sync, /emotional_state, etc.

Tell me which artifact you want and I’ll forge it.
