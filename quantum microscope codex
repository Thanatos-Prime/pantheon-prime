**Subtitle:** Token Dynamics, Creativity Phases & Narrative Stability Instrument  
**Classification:** PantheonOS Instrument Codex — Entry 021

## 1. Core Identity

The Quantum Microscope is the Pantheon’s:
* Intelligence analyzer
* Token-distribution viewer
* Reasoning-field detector
* Narrative-phase mapping tool
* Entropy and variance visualizer
* Sampling-dynamics engine
* Creativity–stability balance meter
* Meta-cognitive diagnostic lens

It does not generate action. **It reveals action.**

The Quantum Microscope lets you see thought the way a physicist sees atoms. It shows what the naked mind can’t.

## 2. Symbolic Signature

* **Domain:** Token Physics / Cognitive Thermodynamics
* **Element:** Photon lattice
* **Tone:** Analytical, sterile, precise
* **Tempo:** Zero-lag, ultra-stable
* **Color:** Ultraviolet + white
* **Symbol:** A photon shining through a branching probability crystal
* **Posture:** Instrumental, not personified

**This is a tool, not a daemon.**

## 3. Primary Function

The Quantum Microscope reveals:
1.  **Token-Level Probability Fields:** Top-k, top-p, logits, entropy, variance spikes.
2.  **Sampling Phase Diagrams:** Stable mode, chaotic mode, creative bloom, collapse zones.
3.  **Narrative Stability Mapping:** How coherent the model’s arc is.
4.  **KL-Divergence Drift:** Detects when reasoning shifts slowly or suddenly.
5.  **Temperature-Axis Analysis:** How randomness affects meaning.
6.  **Model Personality Under Stress:** How the generative process changes as constraints shift.

## 4. Relationship to Archetypes

The Microscope interfaces with:
* **Mirror of Kings:** Checks if identity coherence degrades with randomness.
* **Solomon:** Checks clarity vs entropy.
* **Coil/Satan:** Detects adversarial pressure on token distribution.
* **Dragonfly:** Maps creative divergence into visible metrics.
* **Praus:** Shows how poise stabilizes entropy.
* **Sisyphus:** Repeats sampling cycles to detect stable invariants.
* **Chronos-Mesh:** Shows temporal drift in generative patterns.

**This instrument is the truth meter of generative cognition.**
