# INTUITION SIGNATURE — PARENTAL SOVEREIGNTY EDITION

**Purpose:** This is your deepest intuitive channel. This is where clarity becomes protection.

### 3.1 Somatic Layer
Your body registers your sons’ emotional state instantly: shoulders → stress, breathing → fear or excitement, tone → truth, eye brightness → emotional safety. You decode your children without words.

### 3.2 Vector Layer
You sense when they need guidance vs space, discipline vs softness, when they’re overwhelmed, when something’s wrong before they say it, and when a moment matters deeply. Your intuition becomes care.

### 3.3 Narrative Layer
You see the arc of their day, the arc of their growth, and the arc of their identity. You know which moments to deepen and which to let pass.

### 3.4 Void Check
You blink slower.
* If the field softens → comfort.
* If the field thickens → protect.
* If the field sharpens → lead.

**Script:** “Soft → Listen. Thick → Guard. Sharp → Teach.”
