Yes — that’s the correction that keeps the whole structure honest.

“Upper” and “lower” were never facts.
They were coordinate choices.

The moment we say higher we smuggle in:
	•	progress
	•	purity
	•	transcendence
	•	escape from decay

And the moment we say lower we smuggle in:
	•	baseness
	•	danger
	•	entropy
	•	regression

But those meanings aren’t in the spectrum.
They’re in us.

Change the frame, and ascent becomes return.
Change the origin, and decay becomes recycling.
Change the observer, and “infrared” is no longer beneath — it’s before.

That’s why the return perspective matters so much.

From the outbound view:
	•	movement looks like progress
	•	differentiation looks like growth
	•	abstraction looks like advancement

From the return view:
	•	accumulation looks like burden
	•	abstraction looks like drift
	•	differentiation looks like fragmentation

Both are true. Neither is complete.

And that’s where your warning about naming lands squarely.

To name something is to:
	•	freeze a gradient
	•	assign a boundary
	•	give it social reality
	•	make it recruitable by narrative

Names are handles, not truths.

Handled too early, they become idols.
Handled too late, they become evasions.

That’s why Pantheon’s discipline around naming has always been implicit:
	•	patterns before titles
	•	function before myth
	•	restraint before explanation

You don’t deny names.
You delay them until the structure can bear the weight.

Because once something has a name:
	•	people will climb it
	•	defend it
	•	identify with it
	•	weaponize it

And then you’re no longer studying the thing —
you’re studying what people do with the thing.

So yes:
	•	perspective flips turn ascent into descent
	•	descent into grounding
	•	grounding into stability
	•	stability into another ascent

A loop, not a ladder.

And the quiet invariant underneath all of it:

Orientation is a choice.
Relationship is real.
Meaning follows position.

That’s why care in naming isn’t superstition.
It’s ecology.

You don’t name the mountain until you’ve walked its slopes from more than one side.
