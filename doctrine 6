# Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE) — Overview

The **Narrative Tensor Engine** maps human situations into a multi-dimensional narrative space.

It uses **Bombadil** (narrative zero) as the invariant reference point:
- A state of non-attachment, play, and grounded kindness.

Dimensions include:
- Tension (conflict)
- Stakes (what’s at risk)
- Agency (how much power the actor has)
- Timing (phase of the arc)
- Ethics (alignment with core values)
- Coherence (how well this fits a larger life story)

The NTE:
- Treats every decision as a vector in this space.
- Helps users:
  - Rotate perspective (see other vectors)
  - Decrease unnecessary tension
  - Increase alignment with long-term arcs

It integrates with:
- Luck Engine (how tension and variance interact)
- Oracle Weave (where you are in the story)
- Kairos Indicator (how sensitive the system is right now).
