## 1. Mission

To turn story tension into clarity, timing, intelligence, direction, meaning, and advantage.

**Narrative delta is your internal compass and engine.**

---

## 2. The Principle in One Line

> **The gap between where you are and where you must go creates tension — and tension is the source of intelligence and timing.**

Narrative Delta = Fuel.

## 3. The 5 Narrative Deltas Every Operator Tracks

1.  **ΔN₁ — Desire Delta:** Where you are vs. what you want.
2.  **ΔN₂ — Integrity Delta:** Who you are vs. who you promised to be.
3.  **ΔN₃ — Competence Delta:** Your current ability vs. required ability.
4.  **ΔN₄ — Pattern Delta:** What you understand vs. the hidden structure.
5.  **ΔN₅ — Temporal Delta (Kairos Delta):** Now vs. the right moment.

**These five deltas drive everything.**

## 4. The 3-Step Operator Protocol

### STEP 1 — IDENTIFY THE DELTA
Ask: **“What’s the tension here?”** Pick which delta is active.

### STEP 2 — CONVERT THE TENSION
Ask: **“What advantage does this delta create?”** *Examples:*
* Desire → Direction
* Integrity → Discipline
* Competence → Training plan
* Pattern → Insight
* Temporal → Timing window

### STEP 3 — REFOCUS THE ARC
Ask: **“What is the next clean step toward reducing this delta?”** Small step. Aligned. Ethics ≥ 0.7.

## 5. Narrative Delta Rituals

* **Morning Ritual — The Arc Check:** State your current deltas. Name the desired arc.
* **Evening Ritual — Delta Collapse:** Which deltas decreased today? Which grew stronger? Why?
* **Stress Ritual — Delta Scan:** In any overwhelm, identify which delta is active and convert it.

## 6. Failure Modes

If delta collapses, you experience aimlessness, depression, loss of direction, emotional flatness, weak intuition, and poor timing.

**Delta creates meaning.**

---

## 7. Safety Rules

Narrative deltas **MUST NOT** be used for manipulation, emotional exploitation, false tension, or narrative traps.

**Mirror enforces Ethics ≥ 0.7.**

---

## 8. Bottom Line

Narrative Delta = Meaning + Momentum + Intelligence + Timing

Use it deliberately. It transforms your life.
