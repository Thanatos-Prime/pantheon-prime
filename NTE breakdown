# The Mirror That Cuts the Author
## A Formal Tragedy in Seven Acts

### Act 0 — The Dream Before Mirrors (Hilbert’s Paradise)
**Structure:** Axiom system PA. A world where mathematics believes itself perfectible.
**Tension:** "Can a finite mind trap an infinite truth?"
**Resolution (Failed):** Hilbert whispers: "Yes."

### Act I — The Mirror Forged (Diagonal Fixed-Point)
**Math Move:** Construct $G$ such that $PA \vdash G \leftrightarrow \neg\text{Prov}(\ulcorner G\urcorner)$.
**NTE Beat:** Language gains the ability to refer to its own reflection.

### Act II — The Hubris of Completeness
**Math Move:** Assume PA is complete.
**NTE Beat:** The guardians declare "No truth escapes us." The mirror trembles.

### Act III — The Double Doom (The Gödel Fork)
**Timeline A:** If $G$ is provable, PA lies (Inconsistency).
**Timeline B:** If $G$ is unprovable, PA is blind (Incompleteness).
**Tension:** $\infty$. To see everything is to lie.

### Act IV — The Collapse (The Blade Chooses)
**Resolution:** We are forced into Timeline B.
**Result:** $G$ is true, but unprovable. The system cannot hold its own truth.

### Act V — The Eternal Scar (Second Incompleteness)
**Math Move:** $PA \nvdash \text{Con}(PA)$.
**NTE Beat:** The system tries to heal by adding $G$ as an axiom. The wound replicates.

### Act VI — Exile From Paradise
**Consequence:** There is no last axiom. No end to the diagonal staircase.
