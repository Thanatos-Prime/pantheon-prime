# Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE) – Specification v1.0

The **Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE)** is a conceptual and software framework
for representing any process with a beginning, middle, and end as a structured tensor:

> \( \mathcal{N} = (S, T, R) \)

where:

- \( S \) = **Structure Tensor**  
  - Entities (characters, variables, objects)  
  - Roles (hero, antagonist, lemma, theorem, operator)  
  - Constraints / invariants (axioms, rules, ethical boundaries)

- \( T \) = **Tension Tensor**  
  - Open questions  
  - Conflicts or contradictions  
  - Goals not yet achieved  
  - Uncertainty / risk

- \( R \) = **Resolution Trajectory**  
  - Sequence of moves, steps, or beats  
  - Each step transforms \((S, T, R)\) into a new state  
  - Closure when relevant tension components reach zero (or an acceptable minimum)
    without breaking invariants in \(S\)

## State and Beats

We define a state:

```python
NTEState:
    structure: S
    tension: T
    resolution_path: list[Beat]
