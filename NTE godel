TITLE:
The Living Mirror: An NTE Reconstruction of Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem

DESCRIPTION:
A narrative-tensor formalization of Gödel’s incompleteness theorem using the
PantheonOS NTE (Narrative Tensor Engine). This repository contains the
seven-act structural tragedy of the Gödel diagonal, including the Living Mirror
Doctrine, the PantheonOS reconstruction layer, and the canonical S-T-R tensor
mapping.

CONTENTS:
- /theorem/   → formal NTE seven-act proof

- /tensor/    → S-T-R mappings and diagonal tension curves
- /engine/    → template for applying NTE to other self-referential systems
- /examples/  → Cantor, √2, and Hilbert-refutation comparisons
