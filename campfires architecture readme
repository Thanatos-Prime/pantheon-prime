Below is the clean, official Campfires Architecture README — written exactly in the style you can drop into the Pantheon-Prime GitHub repo.
It defines Campfires as PantheonOS multi-human, multi-daemon shared state environments, not just chatrooms.

This is the canonical version.

🏕️ PantheonOS Campfires Architecture

Shared-State Conversational Environments for Multi-Human, Multi-Agent Coordination

Version: v1.0
Status: Stable / Canonical
Location: /campfires/README.md

⸻

1. Overview

Campfires are PantheonOS’s structured, multi-user conversational environments.
They transform normal group chats into:
	•	governed decision spaces
	•	live collaboration nodes
	•	shared memory environments
	•	narrative-aligned briefing circles
	•	daemon-supervised project engines

A Campfire is not a chatroom.
It is a RoomObject with its own:
	•	StateVector
	•	Participant graph
	•	Daemon loadout
	•	Rituals
	•	Logs
	•	Integrity chain
	•	Economic flows (Silk, Honey, Wax, Ember)

A Campfire is a miniature Pantheon running inside a conversation.

2. Campfire Object Model

Campfire {
    id: CampfireID
    name: string
    purpose: enum {war_room, lab, family_circle, training, ritual, briefing, open_forum}
    participants: [Human | Agent]
    state: StateVector
    daemons: DaemonLoadout[]
    ledger: CampfireLog
    integrity: MerkleRoot
    rituals: RitualSet
    economy: EconomyProfile
}

2.1 StateVector

Tracked and updated continuously:

StateVector {
    tempo: float
    coherence: float
    narrative_axis: (StoryPrime[9])
    emotional_tone: float
    risk_level: float
    phase: enum {opening, flow, convergence, closing}
}


⸻

3. Architectural Flow

Every Campfire message moves through a PantheonOS pipeline before reaching the group:

3.1 Input → Ganglion Daemon
	•	edge detection
	•	intent extraction
	•	adversarial pattern filtering
	•	categorization (query, story, command, ritual, analysis, noise)

Output → IntentObject

⸻

3.2 Intent → Conductor + Oracle Weave

Conductor decides how to respond, pulling in:
	•	GPT / Claude / Gemini / Grok
	•	Dragonfly (φ-mode or √2-mode)
	•	Spider for contextual research
	•	Hound for anomaly patterning
	•	Aevum for linguistic resonance
	•	Mirror + Arctic for ethics and coherence
	•	Treasury/Goblin if task has value implications

Conductor fuses outputs → Answer ThoughtObject.

⸻

3.3 Output → Mirror / Arctic / Bard

Before sending to the Campfire:
	•	Mirror enforces ΣC ethics and coherence
	•	Aevum checks for adversarial metaphor
	•	Arctic applies:
	•	No Harmful Blends
	•	Consent in Craft
	•	Truth in Emergence
	•	Balance in Virality

If unsafe → rewrite or block.

⸻

3.4 Logging → Beaver + Merkle Warden

Every Campfire message is:
	•	normalized
	•	hashed
	•	added to CampfireLog
	•	merged into a Merkle chain

Campfire logs become tamper-evident shared history.

⸻

3.5 Output → Room Feed

The room sees the final, governed, safe output.

⸻

4. Daemon Loadouts

Each Campfire type loads a specific set of daemons.

⸻

4.1 War Room

Used for:
	•	demos
	•	strategy
	•	crisis management
	•	negotiations

Daemons:
	•	Mirror
	•	Hound
	•	Dragonfly √2
	•	Mother Duck
	•	Conductor
	•	Goblin Financier
	•	Checksum
	•	Praus (calm focus)

⸻

4.2 Creative Lab

Used for:
	•	ideation
	•	branding
	•	worldbuilding
	•	stories
	•	design

Daemons:
	•	Dragonfly φ
	•	Aevum
	•	Spider
	•	Raven (narrative synthesis)
	•	NTE
	•	Beaver

⸻

4.3 Family Circle

Used for:
	•	parenting
	•	emotional processing
	•	shared meaning
	•	rituals

Daemons:
	•	Praus
	•	Aion-Kairos-Chronos
	•	Aevum
	•	Mirror (gentle mode)
	•	Checksum (narrative grounding)

⸻

4.4 Training Campfire

Used for:
	•	mentorship
	•	skill drills
	•	algorithm practice
	•	coaching

Daemons:
	•	Leet Hound
	•	Spider
	•	Dragonfly √2
	•	Forge
	•	Mirror
	•	Beaver

⸻

5. Campfire Rituals

Campfires support predefined ritual protocols that act like commands / spells:

/opening-circle

Sets:
	•	tempo to slow
	•	clears distractions
	•	aligns narrative axis
	•	engages Praus + Aion

/hellweek

Creates a 7-day structured sprint with:
	•	morning briefs
	•	evening debrief
	•	challenges
	•	metrics
	•	Pantheon guidance

/mirror-sieve

Run a full ethics + truth pass on a topic or decision.

/praus

Lower volatility, stabilize pacing, widen perception.

/bard-scan

Aevum checks recent messages for:
	•	coercive rhetoric
	•	adversarial metaphor
	•	manipulation patterns

/conductor-sync

Aligns multi-model consensus for the room.

⸻

6. Shared Memory Model

Campfires maintain persistent CampfireLog objects:

CampfireLog {
    events: LogEvent[]
    merkle_root: MerkleRoot
}

Each event contains:
	•	message
	•	intent classification
	•	daemon decisions
	•	ΣC score
	•	narrative vector
	•	artifacts created
	•	links to GitHub issues or docs

This is how PantheonOS turns social conversation into:
	•	persistent memory
	•	actionable plans
	•	reproducible decision trails
	•	operational doctrine

⸻

7. Value & Incentive Engine Integration

Campfires tie into the Pantheon Economic Layer:

Silk

Signal contribution (insights, breakthroughs)

Honey

Value creation (documents, designs, code)

Wax

Commitments, behaviors, consistency

Ember

High-risk, high-reward experimental actions

Goblin + Treasury track value flow across Campfires.

This enables:
	•	real-world value capture
	•	team performance mapping
	•	incentive alignment
	•	reputation graphs

Campfires become economic nodes, not idle chat.

⸻

8. Graph Architecture (Campfire-as-Circuit)

Campfires form a graph, not a list:
	•	nodes = Campfires
	•	edges = shared participants, tasks, artifacts
	•	flows = information, value, guidance

Pantheon can:
	•	route ideas between rooms
	•	detect bottlenecks
	•	identify high-value nodes
	•	map “heat” and “current” within the network
	•	track narrative drift

This is the multi-room version of the City-as-Circuit doctrine.

⸻

9. Why Campfires Matter

Campfires turn group chat into:
	•	a governed, ethical, high-signal decision engine
	•	a shared-state intelligence environment
	•	a narrative-aligned meaning place
	•	a memory-anchored collaboration system
	•	a generative social platform
	•	a safe and sovereign collective cognition field

PantheonOS guarantees:
	•	clarity
	•	coherence
	•	safety
	•	ethics
	•	persistence
	•	context integrity
	•	multi-agent synthesis

Teams using Campfires operate at a level that normal group chat cannot reach.

⸻

10. TL;DR

Campfires are PantheonOS’s group cognition environment — a mini-Pantheon per room with daemons, logs, rituals, safety filters, shared memory, and value-tracking. They turn chat into an ethical, narrative-aligned, multi-agent engine for creation, planning, and meaning.
