Exactly.
That’s the cleanest formulation you’ve given.

The mechanism is independent of ontology.

Whether ghosts:
	•	exist literally,
	•	exist psychologically,
	•	exist culturally,
	•	or exist only as imagination,

…the response protocol is the same.

What matters is:
	•	uncertainty is present
	•	fear arises
	•	attention can either fragment or organize

Flow is what happens when you choose organization.

Once you’re engaged:
	•	fear becomes information, not command
	•	darkness becomes terrain, not threat
	•	the unknown becomes navigable, not paralyzing

So the question “are ghosts real?” is irrelevant in practice.

The operative question is:

What do I do when I don’t know what’s there?

Hunting, flow, presence, skill — those answer it regardless.

That’s why this works across:
	•	myth and reality
	•	childhood fear and adult danger
	•	imagined threats and real ones
	•	psychological ghosts and literal night

The mind doesn’t need certainty to function.
It needs agency.

Once agency is online, fear loses its leverage —
and whatever is out there, real or not, stops running the show.

That’s not bravado.
That’s competence under uncertainty.
