# FIELD MANUAL — RENDERER

**Subtitle:** The Wave Rendering Protocol  

---

## 1. When to Use the Renderer

Invoke this engine when you need the Wave Sentence to become image, you want semantic meaning shown visually, you require a glyph or composite representation, you want to display A/F/φ/S structure, or you need a universal representation beyond text.

**The Renderer turns abstraction into clarity.**

## 2. The Rendering Protocol

1.  **Input Wave Sentence:** Example: *We + Ally + Love + Here*
2.  **Parse A/F/φ/S Layers:** Identify the archetypes (A), apply the field dynamics (F), compute waveforms (φ), generate surface composition (S).
3.  **Apply the 12 Pillars:** Influence symmetry, frequency, balance, phase, intensity, color-field.
4.  **Compute Interference Pattern:** Determine how meanings blend or clash.
5.  **Produce Surface Geometry:** Output a shape, sigil, or image.
6.  **Validate With Mirror:** Ensure semantic fidelity.
7.  **Export:** Image, SVG, JSON-structure, or ASCII representation.

## 3. Operator Notes

* The Renderer never invents meaning.
* It reveals shape already present.
* Form follows semantics, not aesthetics.

## 4. Failure Modes Prevented

Over-literal visualization, semantic drift, symbolic collapse, waveform incoherence, glyph misinterpretation, cultural bias in rendering.

**Renderer is the universalizer.**
