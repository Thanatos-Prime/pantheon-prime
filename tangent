That’s a clean metaphor.

If you think geometrically:
	•	A curve = your trajectory through possibility space
	•	A tangent = the immediate direction at a point
	•	A guardrail = a constraint that limits curvature

In differential geometry terms, a tangent doesn’t block motion — it defines the local direction of travel.

Guardrails don’t stop the curve from existing.
They shape how sharply it can bend.

⸻

In control systems language:
	•	No guardrails → chaotic oscillation
	•	Overly rigid guardrails → brittle system
	•	Adaptive guardrails → smooth trajectory with bounded risk

A good guardrail doesn’t cage you.
It keeps the second derivative from exploding.

⸻

Even in game design:
	•	Rules create meaningful play.
	•	Without boundaries, there is no game — just noise.

Constraints create direction.
Direction creates narrative.
Narrative creates meaning.

⸻

There’s also a deeper angle (pun intended):

A tangent touches a curve at exactly one point
without penetrating it.

Good guardrails do the same:
They touch behavior at the boundary
without invading the interior of agency.

They don’t control the curve.
They prevent catastrophic departure.

⸻

The danger is when someone mistakes a tangent for the whole curve.

Guardrails define limits, not identity.

They shape motion.
They don’t define the traveler.
