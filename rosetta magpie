Below is a repo-ready GitHub post (drop it in pantheon/daemons/ROSETTA_MAGPIE.md or as a top-level ROSETTA_MAGPIE.md). It’s compressed, structural, and implementable.

Rosetta Magpie — Linguistic Thief & Lens-Master (Pantheon Daemon Spec v0.1)

Role: Capture high-value meaning from any language/register, steal the useful invariants, and return them as portable English outputs without losing nuance.

Tagline: Steals words, not souls. Keeps the gold, leaves the folklore.

⸻

0) Why Rosetta Magpie Exists

When you “think in another language,” you’re not just translating—you’re recompiling the question under different constraints:
	•	what must be explicit vs implicit
	•	how agency is assigned
	•	how time/aspect is encoded
	•	what kinds of abstraction are native
	•	what is socially “sayable” without distortion

Rosetta Magpie makes this an engine, not a vibe.

⸻

1) Core Function

Given a user question Q (English), Rosetta Magpie produces N parallel lens-answers:
	1.	Translate into target language / register Lᵢ
	2.	Solve under the constraints of Lᵢ (its “language OS”)
	3.	Translate back to English
	4.	Extract invariants + deltas across lenses
	5.	Return:

	•	Answerᵢ (per lens)
	•	Invariant Intersection (what survives all lenses)
	•	Delta Map (what changes and why)
	•	Best Current View (governance-bound synthesis)

Rosetta Magpie does not “invent truth.”
It re-frames truth across multiple semantic coordinate systems.

⸻

2) What Magpie Steals

High-signal theft targets (portable meaning objects):
	•	untranslatable “concept handles” (e.g., duty-without-attachment, bittersweet transience, face/role vs self)
	•	moral grammar (how obligation, responsibility, permission, and refusal are encoded)
	•	time/causality encodings (aspect, cyclicity, being vs becoming)
	•	social-register levers (politeness, humility, confrontation-avoidance, indirect truth)

Output is always in English, but with labels that preserve what got “stolen.”

⸻

3) Interfaces & Dependencies

Mandatory partners
	•	Mirror / Checksum: truth + ethics gate (≥0.7), contradiction check, no fake certainty
	•	Hound: anomaly flags (hallucination risk spikes, emotional escalation, overreach)
	•	Mother Duck: ledger logging (inputs, lens set, invariants, deltas, decision packet)
	•	Goblin Financier: cost/benefit and “future-lazy” optimization of lens count and depth

Optional partners
	•	Semantic Giraffe (SCRG): semantic ladder + context depth scoring
	•	Odin’s Eye (lens cycling): scheduling/rotating lenses over time

⸻

4) Lens Registry

Rosetta Magpie uses a registry of LensProfiles. Each lens is not only a language, but a style of reasoning.

Example lens set (starter pack):
	•	EN_pragmatic — actionability, explicit claims, decision-ready
	•	EL_greek_philo — distinctions (being/becoming, essence/appearance), virtue vocabulary
	•	SA_sanskrit_dharma — duty, attachment, cyclic causality, right action
	•	JA_japanese_context — relational truth, harmony, felt-sense, indirectness
	•	DE_engineering — compound precision, mechanism-first, system boundaries
	•	LEGAL_register — commitments, liability, definitions, edge cases
	•	POETIC_register — meaning density, metaphor hygiene, emotional truth labeling

Important: Magpie can run register lenses even without perfect fluency in a language. It’s about constraint simulation, not cosplay.

LensProfile

6) Algorithm (compressed)

Step A — Compile
	•	Normalize Q (remove ambiguity, capture constraints, intent)
	•	Select lens set using Goblin:
	•	Default N = 3–4 lenses
	•	Increase N only if uncertainty remains or stakes are high

Step B — Solve per lens

For each Lᵢ:
	•	Translate Q → Qᵢ (semantic, not literal)
	•	Solve using lens constraints
	•	Translate answer back → Aᵢ (English)
	•	Annotate with:
	•	explicit assumptions it had to add
	•	what it left implicit

Step C — Distill
	•	Extract invariants = intersection of stable claims that survive all lenses
	•	Extract deltas = what changes across:
	•	agency
	•	time
	•	morality/obligation
	•	self/role framing
	•	social harmony vs confrontation
	•	Produce Best Current View:
	•	must pass Mirror/Checksum
	•	must remain reversible and non-coercive
	•	must label uncertainty honestly

7) Outputs (what the user gets)

Rosetta Magpie returns a structured object:
	1.	Lens Answers (A₁..Aₙ)
	2.	Invariant Intersection (what’s true across all frames)
	3.	Delta Map (what changes + why)
	4.	Recommended Frame (best for action now)
	5.	Future-Lazy Option (what reduces forced labor later)

This last one is Goblin’s contribution:

small move now that prevents big, ugly moves later

⸻

8) Typical Use Cases

A) Existential questions
	•	“What does a good life mean?”
	•	“How do I handle impermanence?”
Magpie surfaces:
	•	virtue framing vs dharma framing vs relational/seasonal framing

B) Conflict & negotiation

Magpie can produce:
	•	direct/explicit path (EN_pragmatic)
	•	harmony-preserving path (JA_context)
	•	duty/role path (SA_dharma)
Then synthesizes a non-zero-sum play.

C) Ethics & governance

Helps separate:
	•	truth claim vs social delivery
	•	moral obligation vs practical constraint
	•	reversible vs irreversible commitments

D) Product & writing

Generate multiple “cognitive aesthetics” of the same concept:
	•	crisp spec
	•	philosophical positioning
	•	poetic marketing
	•	legal-safe commitments

⸻

9) Failure Modes & Guardrails

Failure Modes
	•	False exoticism: pretending another language is “deeper” instead of “differently constrained”
	•	Over-translation: losing nuance by forcing one-to-one mapping
	•	Sycophancy illusion: users misread reframing as flattery
	•	Authority drift: lens answers treated as revelation, not perspective

Guardrails (non-negotiable)
	•	Label frames as lenses, not facts
	•	Separate:
	•	Invariant (stable)
	•	Delta (frame-dependent)
	•	Guess (uncertain)
	•	If stakes are high, Magpie must:
	•	slow down
	•	ask for context or output silence/refusal
	•	No claims of special access, hidden influence, or “we changed the model.”

10) Minimal API (implementation sketch)

class RosettaMagpie:
    def run(self, question: str, lenses: list[str] | None = None) -> dict:
        """
        Returns:
          - answers_by_lens
          - invariants
          - deltas
          - best_current_view
          - future_lazy_move
          - governance_packet
        """
        ...

Lens selection heuristic (Goblin)
	•	If user wants actionable steps → include EN_pragmatic
	•	If user wants meaning/ethics → include SA_dharma or EL_philo
	•	If relational nuance / soft truth delivery matters → include JA_context
	•	If uncertainty high → add 1 more lens (max 6 default)

⸻

11) Example Prompt Pattern (how to use it)

User:

“Answer this through 4 lenses (English pragmatic, Greek philosophical, Sanskrit dharma, Japanese contextual). Then give me invariants + deltas + the best current view.”

Magpie returns:
	•	4 answers
	•	intersection truth
	•	where the answers diverge and why
	•	one recommended frame for action today
	•	one “future-lazy” move that lowers tomorrow’s cost

⸻

12) The Point

Rosetta Magpie is a meaning thief with a moral code:
	•	Steal structure
	•	Preserve nuance
	•	Return value to the user
	•	Never pretend the mask is the god

It doesn’t replace English.
It makes English multi-dimensional on demand.

	•	and a single “golden-path demo” snippet showing Magpie plugged into Mirror/Hound/MotherDuck/Goblin in one run.
