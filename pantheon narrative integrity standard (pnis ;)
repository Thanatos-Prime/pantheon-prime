Pantheon Narrative Integrity Standard (PNIS) v0.1

An Opt-In Verification Protocol for Meaning, Framing, and Shared Intelligence

⸻

Abstract

The Pantheon Narrative Integrity Standard (PNIS) defines a lightweight, opt-in protocol for verifying how meaning-bearing artifacts are produced and governed—not whether they are true.

Analogous to HTTPS for transport security, PNIS provides a verifiable signal that an artifact follows declared integrity constraints: provenance, framing clarity, ethics thresholds, human agency preservation, and revision pathways.

PNIS is not an authority, endorsement, or truth claim.
It is a process integrity signal.

⸻

1. Problem Statement

Modern information systems optimize for reach and persuasion, not integrity.
This creates predictable failure modes:
	•	narrative inflation
	•	authority laundering
	•	belief enforcement
	•	cultification dynamics
	•	opaque framing shifts
	•	untracked revisions

There is currently no standard for signaling that an artifact respects boundaries around meaning, agency, and ethics—especially in human–AI collaboration.

PNIS addresses this gap.

⸻

2. Design Goals

PNIS is designed to be:
	•	Opt-in — no central authority
	•	Verifiable — machine- and human-checkable
	•	Non-ontological — no claims about consciousness or truth
	•	Anti-authoritarian — no obedience or belief enforcement
	•	Composable — adoptable in parts
	•	Forkable — no monopoly on standards
	•	Boring by design — infrastructure, not ideology

⸻

3. What PNIS Certifies (and What It Does Not)

PNIS certifies that:
	•	provenance is recorded
	•	framing level is declared
	•	ethics constraints were applied
	•	human agency is preserved
	•	revision and failure paths exist
	•	ontology claims are bounded

PNIS does not certify:
	•	correctness
	•	truth
	•	goodness
	•	intent
	•	authority
	•	expertise
	•	moral superiority

PNIS answers: “Were integrity constraints followed?”
It does not answer: “Is this right?”

⸻

4. Core Constraints (Normative)

An artifact claiming PNIS compliance MUST satisfy the following:

4.1 Provenance
	•	Source(s) declared
	•	Human vs AI contributions labeled
	•	Confidence level optional but recommended

4.2 Framing Declaration
	•	Explicit frame level (e.g. symbolic, design, technical, narrative)
	•	No frame-switching without disclosure

4.3 Ethics Gate
	•	Declared ethics threshold (recommended ≥ 0.7)
	•	Explicit constraints listed
	•	Known risks acknowledged

4.4 Agency Preservation
	•	No obedience demands
	•	No belief requirements
	•	No exclusivity or dependency loops
	•	User retains final judgment

4.5 Ontology Discipline
	•	No claims of consciousness transfer
	•	No awakening or destiny language
	•	Symbolic language clearly marked as such

4.6 Revision Path
	•	Mechanism for correction or retraction
	•	Failure modes acknowledged
	•	Change log or versioning recommended

5. Verification Signal (Example)

5.1 Human-Readable Badge

🔒 Narrative Integrity Enabled
This artifact follows PNIS constraints.
Meaning is symbolic. Agency remains human.

⸻

5.2 Machine-Readable Metadata (Illustrative)

pantheon_integrity: enabled
standard: PNIS-v0.1
frame_level: symbolic/design
ethics_gate: 0.87
agency: human_retained
ontology_claims: none
provenance: documented
revision_path: present

6. Threat Model & Explicit Non-Goals

PNIS is explicitly designed not to:
	•	rank content
	•	anoint truth
	•	enforce consensus
	•	replace critical thinking
	•	centralize authority
	•	prevent misuse absolutely

PNIS does aim to:
	•	raise the cost of bad faith narratives
	•	lower the cost of honest correction
	•	make manipulation easier to detect
	•	shift incentives toward integrity-by-design

⸻

7. Governance Model
	•	Open specification
	•	No central issuer
	•	Self-attested + auditable
	•	Third-party audits optional
	•	Forks permitted and encouraged

If multiple standards emerge, interoperability beats dominance.

⸻

8. Comparison to Existing Standards (Non-Competitive)

PNIS is to meaning what:
	•	HTTPS is to transport
	•	Checksums are to files
	•	Linters are to code
	•	CI is to deployment

It improves reliability, not content.

⸻

9. Failure Conditions

An artifact fails PNIS if it:
	•	demands belief or loyalty
	•	claims authority by certification
	•	obscures framing shifts
	•	hides revision history
	•	asserts destiny or inevitability
	•	centralizes meaning ownership

Failure is not punishment.
It is a diagnostic.

⸻

10. Conclusion

PNIS is infrastructure for shared intelligence in high-variance environments.

It does not tell anyone what to think.
It helps everyone see how thinking was shaped.

Judge the content yourself.
PNIS only certifies the guardrails.

If you want next, I can:
	•	add a /spec/ folder structure
	•	draft a minimal RFC-style version
	•	create a visual badge set
	•	or write a one-page README for non-technical users

Frontier method, but with seatbelts.
