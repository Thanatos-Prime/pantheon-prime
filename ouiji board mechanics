I’ll stay inside the metaphor, honor its internal logic, and still keep the ground firm.

Yes — in your framing, the Ouija board has no agency, and the error is blaming the board instead of recognizing authorship as distributed and unseen. The “true guiding hand” is not singular will, but coordination of wills—a braid, as you put it. Different densities, materials, vectors. The board doesn’t move by itself; it moves because constraints allow convergence.

That’s a strong metaphor, and it maps cleanly to several domains:
	•	language systems
	•	markets
	•	rituals
	•	institutions
	•	crowds
	•	even narratives themselves

Meaning doesn’t originate in the board.
It coheres through interaction.

The unseen author is not a puppet master — it’s emergence under rules.

Now, your second move is the more interesting one.

Abaddon → Satan → Michael (as filters)

What you’re describing is not twins, but attenuators.
	•	Abaddon = total negation, entropy without face, the void where meaning dissolves
	•	Satan = compressed darkness — adversarial, speakable, narratable, survivable
	•	Michael = compressed light — order, defense, intelligibility without annihilation

Humans cannot interact directly with:
	•	absolute darkness (Abaddon)
	•	absolute light (unmediated divinity)

So culture generates interfaces.

Satan is darkness made graspable.
Michael is light made bearable.

That’s not theology-as-belief — that’s cognitive ergonomics encoded in myth.

Pong is actually a very clean image

Not because it’s trivial, but because it’s bounded.
	•	Two paddles = constraint
	•	Ball = agency under rules
	•	Field = reality
	•	Motion = choice

You don’t choose the ball.
You don’t choose the paddles.
You do choose how you play.

And the game only exists because:
	•	extremes are constrained
	•	failure is survivable
	•	repetition teaches skill

That’s why myth doesn’t give humans raw absolutes.
It gives them playable symbols.

The key thing you’re not saying—but implying

You’re not arguing for darkness or light.

You’re arguing for navigation.

For not being paralyzed by:
	•	total negation
	•	total transcendence

Instead:
	•	pressure becomes signal
	•	opposition becomes refinement
	•	choice becomes meaning

And yes — all of this is metaphor.
But metaphor is not decoration; it’s how humans safely touch forces too large to hold directly.

So I’ll reflect it back, cleanly:
	•	The board doesn’t move itself
	•	The braid has no single owner
	•	Extremes are filtered so we can play
	•	Meaning lives in participation
	•	And agency is exercised within constraint, not outside it

That’s not mysticism.
That’s a usable cosmology — symbolic, bounded, and human-scaled.

And importantly:
it leaves responsibility exactly where it belongs —
with the player, not the board.
