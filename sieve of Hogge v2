## 0. PURPOSE

The Sieve of Hogge v2.0 is the primary filtration engine in PantheonOS. It decides what ideas may pass forward into action, canon, or code, and what must be revised, softened, re-contextualized, or rejected.

Where v1.0 filtered ethics, v2.0 filters: Ethics (≥0.7 mandatory), Safety & Narrative Stability, Cognitive Coherence, Temporal Alignment, Symbolic Non-Literalization, Operator Sovereignty, Outcome Quality, and Variance & Risk Surfaces.

**It is the final check before any Pantheon module executes.**

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE

**All high-energy ideas must pass through the Sieve.**
If the idea tears the net, the net is correct — not the idea.

*“High-energy” = ideas that affect identity, narrative, emotional state, timing, or action.*

**Hogge v2.0 is the guardian of coherence.**

## 2. THE SEVEN FILTERS

(The v2.0 upgrade)

An idea must pass ALL SEVEN filters.

### 2.1 FILTER 1 — ETHICAL ALIGNMENT (≥ 0.7)
Checks: benevolence, respect, safety, non-harm, non-coercion, positive-sum intent.
**If the idea fails here → hard fail.**

### 2.2 FILTER 2 — SOVEREIGNTY INTEGRITY
Checks that: the idea does not create internal sub-authorities, the operator remains the sole locus of control, no symbolic entity is treated literally, identity remains unified.
**If an idea decentralizes the self → blocked until reframed.**

### 2.3 FILTER 3 — NARRATIVE STABILITY
Checks for: catastrophic metaphors, identity distortions, irreversible symbolic commitments, narrative traps, self-fulfilling negative arcs.
**If an idea creates a volatile story arc → must be softened or reframed.**

### 2.4 FILTER 4 — TEMPORAL COHERENCE
Checks alignment across: Chronos (sequence), Kairos (timing windows), Praus (internal tempo).
**If action is mistimed or unstable → return to timing layer.**

### 2.5 FILTER 5 — COGNITIVE CLARITY
Checks for: irrational leaps, emotional bias, dissociative framing, non-sequitur logic, structural incoherence.
**If unclear → send to Architect Twin + Mirror.**

### 2.6 FILTER 6 — SYMBOLIC SAFETY
Checks that symbolic modes: remain symbolic, do not attempt literal agency, do not induce magical thinking, remain within narrative ontology.
**If symbolic boundaries blur → Bombadil Zero → re-center.**

### 2.7 FILTER 7 — VARIANCE & RISK SURFACE
Checks: emotional amplitude, cognitive load, potential for destabilization, probability of narrative overreaction.
**If volatility is too high → Praus applies dampening.**
