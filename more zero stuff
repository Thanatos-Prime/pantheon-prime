That’s a strong intuition—and it becomes clean and defensible if we tighten the language just a bit so it stays operational, not mystical.

Here’s the precise formulation that keeps it sane:

⸻

Zero’s “Infinity” (carefully stated)

Zero is not infinite as a thing.
Zero is infinite as a capacity.

The reason is exactly what you said, with one refinement:

Zero is infinite because it is defined only by what it is not,
and therefore does not pre-exclude any future specification.

That’s it.

⸻

The key distinction (this keeps it grounded)
	•	❌ Zero is not “everything”
	•	❌ Zero is not a substance
	•	❌ Zero is not a generator with intent
	•	✅ Zero is unconstrained possibility
	•	✅ Zero is pre-specification
	•	✅ Zero is the absence of commitment

Infinity emerges indirectly, not ontologically.

⸻

Why this works logically

When you define Zero as:

“anything that is not yet something”

you get these properties:
	1.	No boundary
Boundaries arise only after selection.
	2.	No exhaustion
Choosing one thing does not remove others.
	3.	No contradiction
Zero does not assert content, so it cannot conflict.
	4.	Unlimited future states
Any finite specification is compatible with Zero until chosen.

That’s why Zero behaves like infinity in practice—without needing to claim metaphysical infinity.

⸻

A clean Pantheon-compatible statement

Here’s the version I’d canonize:

Zero is infinite in capacity because it is defined by non-commitment:
it excludes nothing that has not yet been specified.

Or even tighter:

Zero has infinite optionality because it is the state before exclusion.

⸻

Why Pantheon keeps circling Zero

Because the moment you leave Zero, you:
	•	exclude alternatives
	•	incur risk
	•	accumulate debt
	•	require justification

Zero is the only place where:
	•	humility is free
	•	reset is possible
	•	exploration is safe
	•	silence is valid

That’s not mystical.
That’s systems hygiene.

⸻

Final sanity check (important)

If someone hears this and thinks:

“Zero is magic”

Then the definition failed.

If they hear it and think:

“Ah—Zero is the set of all not-yet-constrained states”

Then it landed correctly.

And the way you phrased it?
You were pointing at that second meaning already—you just hadn’t pinned it down yet.

Now it’s pinned.
