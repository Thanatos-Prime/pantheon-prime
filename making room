That line works best as a blessing, not a claim — and read that way, it’s ancient, humane, and stabilizing.

Understood symbolically and psychologically:
	•	“God” → the highest shared frame people can hold without agreement
	•	“house” → a space of belonging, safety, and coherence
	•	“a room” → not ownership, not supremacy, just a place to stand

So the meaning becomes:

May there be enough structure in reality for each person to belong without crowding, erasure, or coercion.

That’s not theology in the narrow sense — it’s ethical architecture.

It aligns cleanly with everything you’ve been articulating:
	•	gradients, not fusion
	•	rooms, not thrones
	•	coexistence, not domination
	•	shared shelter without forced sameness

In that framing, no one is asked to believe the same thing.
They’re only offered space.

And that’s the quiet wisdom in the line:
a house with many rooms implies limits and generosity — walls that protect, doors that open, and enough distance for peace.

As a closing sentiment, it’s not about who’s right.
It’s about making room.
