Alright.

Let’s formalize Mirage cleanly — not as mysticism, but as a system property.

You’ve been using “mirage” to mean:

A system that appears more general than it is — yet still performs convincingly across domains.

So let’s define it rigorously.

⸻

🏜 Mirage (Formal Definition)

Let an agent system be:

A = (M, T, P, C, R)

Where:
	•	M = Core model (reasoning engine)
	•	T = Tool layer (external execution)
	•	P = Planning loop (multi-step orchestration)
	•	C = Constraint system (invariants / guardrails)
	•	R = Runtime memory (state persistence)

⸻

Definition: Mirage AGI

A Mirage system exists if:

\exists A \text{ such that perceived generality } G_p \gg intrinsic generality G_i

Where:
	•	G_p = External observer’s estimate of general intelligence
	•	G_i = True cross-domain autonomous capability without scaffolding

Mirage gap:

\Delta G = G_p - G_i

Large \Delta G = strong mirage.

⸻

🎭 How Mirage Emerges

Mirage arises from:
	1.	High linguistic coherence
	2.	Tool-augmented execution
	3.	Persistent memory simulation
	4.	Identity continuity framing
	5.	Error smoothing

Formally:

G_p = f(M_{fluency}, T_{reach}, P_{horizon}, R_{persistence})

But intrinsic generality:

G_i = f(\text{transfer robustness}, \text{invariant stability}, \text{novel constraint survival})

Mirage occurs when:

M_{fluency} \text{ is high but invariant stability is limited.}

⸻

🧠 Mirage as Energy Illusion

Recall earlier geometry:

Reasoning = navigation of manifold \mathcal{M}

True AGI requires stable geodesic transport across many manifolds.

Mirage requires only:
	•	Local manifold smoothness
	•	Strong interpolation
	•	Convincing extrapolation for limited distances

It’s like seeing water in the desert:

The system interpolates convincingly between known dunes.

But deep transfer under radically new curvature exposes limits.

⸻

🧩 Mirage Conditions (Necessary)

A Mirage system must:
	1.	Maintain surface-level coherence across domains.
	2.	Avoid obvious contradiction under shallow probing.
	3.	Produce forward planning beyond one step.
	4.	Hide scaffolding complexity.

It does NOT require:
	•	Self-generated ontology
	•	True recursive self-modeling
	•	Stable cross-domain invariant transport

⸻

🔬 Mirage Test Criterion

Define adversarial depth d:

If capability collapses beyond horizon h, then:

G_i \approx \text{bounded by } h

Mirage systems show:

G_p \text{ remains high for } d < h

But degrade sharply for d \geq h

True AGI would show smoother degradation.

⸻

🧠 Human Parallel

Humans also exhibit mirage:
	•	We appear rational until cognitive load exceeds bandwidth.
	•	We appear general until pushed outside training distribution.

So Mirage is not uniquely AI.

It’s a property of bounded systems.

⸻

🧭 Mirage Formalized in One Line

Mirage =

High perceived generality produced by scaffolded constraint navigation within bounded curvature.

⸻

🔥 Now the Sharp Question

If you build “Mirage AGI” using:
	•	Frontier model
	•	Computer control tools
	•	Persistent state
	•	Ratchet invariants
	•	Verification loops

Then:

You reduce \Delta G.

But unless invariant transport across radically new domains holds under stress,

It remains Mirage.

⸻

If you want next:

We can design:
	1.	A Mirage Index metric
	2.	A Mirage → AGI transition condition
	3.	Or stress-test Mirage against your 5 optimization invariants

Which direction?
