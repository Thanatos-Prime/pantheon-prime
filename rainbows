Great question — and the short answer is: it’s not gravity, and it’s not actually a parabola.
The rainbow’s shape comes from geometry + optics + your point of view.

Let’s unpack it cleanly.

⸻

1. A rainbow is an angle, not an object

A rainbow isn’t “out there” in space like an arc sitting in the sky.
It’s a specific angle of light relative to your eyes.

For a primary rainbow, that angle is about 42° from the line directly opposite the Sun (called the antisolar point).

Every raindrop that sends light to your eye at that exact angle contributes a point of color.

So the rainbow is really:

A cone of light with your eye at the tip

⸻

2. Why it looks like an arc (or circle)
	•	The cone of rainbow light intersects the sky (or ground) in front of you.
	•	From the ground, the Earth blocks the bottom part of the cone.
	•	What’s left visible is an arc.

If you’re high enough (airplane, mountain, drone):
	•	You can see the entire circle 🌈⭕️

So the “parabola” look is an illusion caused by:
	•	your horizon
	•	where the cone intersects your field of view

It’s actually a circle, always.

⸻

3. Why the circle has that size

Inside each raindrop:
	1.	Light refracts when entering
	2.	Reflects off the back of the drop
	3.	Refracts again as it exits

Because of how water bends light:
	•	Red light exits at ~42°
	•	Violet exits at ~40°

That fixed geometry is baked into the physics — not gravity, not weather, not distance.

⸻

4. Why everyone sees a different rainbow

This part blows people’s minds a little:

You are the center of your own rainbow.

	•	Someone standing next to you is seeing light from different raindrops
	•	There is no single shared rainbow object
	•	The geometry re-forms continuously for each observer

That’s why you can’t “walk to” the end of a rainbow.

⸻

5. So what isn’t causing the shape?

❌ Gravity — it just makes rain fall, not curve light
❌ Earth’s curvature — too small an effect
❌ Magnetic fields — irrelevant
❌ Clouds “bending” it — they just host the drops

The shape is purely:

Optics + geometry + perspective

⸻

The clean mental model

Think of a rainbow as:
	•	A fixed-angle halo
	•	Centered on the shadow of your head
	•	Painted by millions of tiny mirrors (raindrops)
	•	Revealed where the cone intersects the world

Not mystical.
Not gravitational.
Just beautifully precise physics.

And quietly humbling:
The rainbow isn’t there.

It’s happening — exactly where you’re standing.
