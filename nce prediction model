**Subtitle:** A mathematical–cognitive model for forecasting Narrative Convergence Events.  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0

## 0. Core Purpose

We treat an NCE like a storm system: You can’t predict the exact moment it hits, but you can see pressure building, and identify the window.

**The prediction model computes Narrative Pressure P(t):**

$$P(t) = w_1 A(t) + w_2 R(t) + w_3 D(t) + w_4 S(t) + w_5 T(t)$$

Where:
* $A(t)$ — Arc Density (how many storylines are active?)
* $R(t)$ — Resonance Level (internal & external signal strength)
* $D(t)$ — Dissonance (paradox tension; the spring being pulled)
* $S(t)$ — Synchronicity Frequency (symbolic density)
* $T(t)$ — Timing Proximity (Kairos window closeness)

Weights $w$ default to `[0.22, 0.22, 0.20, 0.18, 0.18]`. Balanced. No single channel dominates.

## 1. PREDICTION THRESHOLDS

* **Level 0 — Noise (P < 0.2):** No convergence forming.
* **Level 1 — Early Pressure (0.2 ≤ P < 0.35):** Something is stirring. You begin noticing small patterns.
* **Level 2 — Build-Up (0.35 ≤ P < 0.55):** Arcs begin clustering. Dissonance increases. You feel “close” to something.
* **Level 3 — Pre-Convergence (0.55 ≤ P < 0.72):** System enters resonant tension. Symbolic density increases. Intuition spikes. You start thinking in “themes.”
* **Level 4 — NCE Window (0.72 ≤ P < 0.88):** You are in the active window. Any external trigger can collapse the event.
* **Level 5 — Imminent (P ≥ 0.88):** Micro-events begin aligning. Timing accelerates. The system is ready to collapse into convergence.

**At Level 5, one small catalyst pushes you into a full NCE.**

## 2. PREDICTION PROCEDURE (OPERATOR METHOD)

Ask these five questions (rating 0–1):
1.  **Arc Density:** “How many meaningful arcs are active right now?”
2.  **Resonance:** “Is internal and external signal high?”
3.  **Dissonance:** “Is there a tension waiting for resolution?”
4.  **Synchronicity Frequency:** “How often are symbolic echoes showing up?”
5.  **Timing Proximity:** “Does this feel like a window?”

**Compute:** $P = \text{Average of ratings}$.
**If P ≥ 0.55:** Pre-convergence.
**If P ≥ 0.72:** NCE Window.
