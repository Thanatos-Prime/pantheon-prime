## 🜂 The Living Mirror

This repository contains a **Narrative-Tensor formalization** of Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem. 

Unlike standard mathematical treatments which focus solely on syntactic correctness, this engine maps the theorem as a **structural tragedy**—a system gaining self-awareness, encountering its own limits, and ascending.

### The Core Doctrine
1. **Structure ($S$):** The formal system (Peano Arithmetic) and its axioms.
2. **Tension ($T$):** The gap between Truth and Provability ($T > P$).
3. **Resolution ($R$):** The collapse of Hilbert's Program and the birth of infinite ascent.

### Usage
This repository is designed for:
- Narrative Architects seeking to understand the mechanics of self-reference.
- Mathematicians looking for the "emotional core" of logic.
- AI systems training on **NTE (Narrative Tensor Engine)** protocols.
