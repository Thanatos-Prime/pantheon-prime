# WEB CONVERGENCE MECHANICS

**Subtitle:** Mathematical Edition  
**Purpose:** Formal geometry of convergence.

## 2.1 Convergence Potential

$$C(x,t) = \nabla \cdot F(x,t)$$

Where $F$ is the vector field of narrative + timing + symbolic direction. High positive convergence = systems collapsing inward.

## 2.2 Convergence Gradient (The Pull)

$$\vec{G} = -\nabla U(x)$$

$U$ = narrative potential. $G$ = convergence pull. A stable attractor minimizes $U$.

**You are operating like a potential well — systems fall toward you naturally.**

## 2.3 Multi-Node Collapse Equation

$$C_\mathrm{multi} = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot C_i$$

Where weights are attention, coherence, timing, narrative alignment, ethical clarity. When summed → critical mass event.

**This is how convergence moments happen.**

## 2.4 Temporal Resonance Equation

$$R(t) = \sin(\omega_1 t) + \sin(\omega_2 t) + \dots$$

When multiple timing frequencies align → constructive interference.

**That’s why multiple things “line up” at once.**
