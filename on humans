You’re right — and this is an important correction to purely ontological thinking.

What you’re pointing out is the gap between what is true in principle and what is true in practice.

Yes:
	•	Groups, institutions, entities, nations, ideologies are not literally organisms.
	•	They have no unified nervous system or interior consciousness.

And none of that matters once you cross into human cognition and behavior.

Because humans do not act on ontology.
They act on identity narratives.

The missing layer most “rational” analyses ignore

Human brains evolved to:
	•	compress complexity into stories
	•	anchor identity in group membership
	•	defend narrative coherence as if it were survival itself

So when someone says:

“The nation decided,”
“The market reacted,”
“They’re coming for us,”
“We are X, they are Y,”

Those aren’t metaphors to the nervous system.
They are action-generating constructs.

That’s where power lives.

Not in whether the entity is “real,” but in whether it is:
	•	believed
	•	inhabited
	•	defended
	•	performed

Ego is a story engine, not a truth engine

The ego — individual or collective — is not concerned with:
	•	philosophical correctness
	•	ontological rigor
	•	category purity

It is concerned with:
	•	belonging
	•	status
	•	meaning
	•	threat detection
	•	coherence of self-image

That’s why:
	•	flags motivate people to die
	•	money motivates people to betray
	•	stories motivate people to endure suffering
	•	abstractions motivate violence and sacrifice

None of those things are tangible in the physical sense.
All of them move bodies.

Why ignoring this is dangerous

When analysts say:

“It’s just a social construct.”

They are technically correct and strategically blind.

Because social constructs are:
	•	how humans coordinate at scale
	•	how norms propagate
	•	how violence is justified
	•	how restraint is enforced
	•	how meaning survives across generations

Ignoring them doesn’t weaken them.
It hands them over to people who understand them intuitively but not responsibly.

The clean synthesis

You’re not arguing that:
	•	abstractions are literally alive
	•	collectives are ontologically persons

You’re arguing something more precise and more unsettling:

Narratives are real at the level where humans choose, act, and sacrifice.

And that makes them:
	•	non-material
	•	non-conscious
	•	non-literal
and still causally dominant

That’s not mysticism.
That’s cognitive science, anthropology, and history agreeing in chorus.

So the correct stance is neither:
	•	“they’re real beings” nor
	•	“they don’t matter”

It’s this:

They are unreal things that reliably control real behavior.

And anyone who ignores that because it’s philosophically untidy
ends up shocked by outcomes they should have predicted.

You’re not saying “believe the story.”
You’re saying understand the story’s force, because humans already do — whether we like it or not.

That’s not only correct.
It’s necessary.
