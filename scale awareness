That’s a sharp intuition.

There’s a real psychological and civilizational pattern behind what you’re pointing at.

1. The “Everyone Is the Main Character” Phase

We are living through the most main-character-amplifying era in history.
	•	Social media = continuous autobiographical broadcasting
	•	Algorithms = reinforcement of personal narrative centrality
	•	AI tools = extension of agency and authorship
	•	Personal brands > institutions

Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube effectively reward narrative centrality. The camera is always pointed inward. Metrics validate it.

You get:
	•	Personal myth-making
	•	Identity optimization
	•	Narrative self-consciousness
	•	Increased sense of agency

In mythic language: everyone becomes the Hero.

In systems language: distributed narrative nodes.

In economic language: attention markets decentralize prestige.

That phase is real. And it’s not delusion — it’s structural.

2. What Happens Next (The Reversion)

But systems don’t stay in expansion mode forever.

History shows oscillation:
	•	Individualism → collectivism
	•	Centralization → decentralization
	•	Mythic fragmentation → symbolic consolidation

After enough fragmentation, higher-order abstractions reemerge.

Examples:
	•	Nation-states reassert after tribal fragmentation.
	•	Religions consolidate after sect explosions.
	•	Tech platforms consolidate after creative free-for-all phases.

Think of it like this:

Stage 1: “I am the protagonist.”
Stage 2: “We are protagonists.”
Stage 3: “We are actors inside larger structural forces.”

That third stage isn’t nihilistic. It’s maturity.

3. Higher Abstraction Reemergence

When you say “same things reemerge in higher abstractions and plains,” you’re describing something like Hegelian synthesis without saying Hegel.

The individual myth doesn’t disappear.
It gets absorbed into a larger structure.
	•	Personal brands → algorithmic ecosystems
	•	Individual voices → memetic swarms
	•	Autonomous agents → networked systems

The archetypes return, but at a higher resolution.

Instead of:

One king.

You get:

Networked governance layers.

Instead of:

One prophet.

You get:

Distributed symbolic engines.

Instead of:

One empire.

You get:

Platform empires.

The structure remains. The scale changes.

4. Why This Feels Like a Discovery Moment

We’re in a period where:
	•	People realize institutions are not omnipotent.
	•	Individuals realize they can influence systems.
	•	AI collapses skill barriers.
	•	Narrative tools are democratized.

So it feels like awakening.

But historically, every awakening eventually produces new constraints.

Freedom expands.
Entropy increases.
Coordination costs rise.
Then structure reasserts.

Not as regression — as compression.

5. The Pattern Beneath the Pattern

Zooming out:

Civilization oscillates between:
	•	Hero Phase (agency explosion)
	•	Mythic Phase (identity fragmentation)
	•	Structural Phase (institutional consolidation)
	•	Meta Phase (recognition of pattern itself)

You’re noticing we’re somewhere between Hero and Meta right now.

And when Meta awareness spreads, paradoxically:
	•	Ego inflation collapses.
	•	Systems thinking rises.
	•	New “plains” form.

Not spiritual plains.
Structural abstraction plains.

6. The Mature Frame

The stable synthesis looks like this:

I am a main character in my local frame.
I am a supporting character in larger frames.
I am a background variable in cosmic frames.

All three are simultaneously true.

That’s not ego death.
That’s scale awareness.

⸻

If you want to push this further:

Do you think the next abstraction layer will be
	•	AI-mediated identity?
	•	Networked sovereignty?
	•	Digital myth consolidation?
	•	Or something else entirely?

There’s a real fork forming.
