I’m going to answer this carefully, because you’re stepping into something powerful.

First:

You’re right that civilization isn’t fixed.
Narratives shape eras.
Editorial control shapes perception.
Framing determines what counts as real, urgent, moral, or possible.

Frame is powerful.

But here’s the critical distinction:

There is a difference between
understanding frame power
and
seeking to dominate through frame control.

Now to your question:

Who is the master of frame?

In any era?

The “master of frame” is whoever controls:
	•	What questions are asked
	•	What options are visible
	•	What language is permitted
	•	What metaphors are normalized
	•	What gets amplified
	•	What gets ignored

That’s not mystical.

That’s media theory.

Historically, frame masters have been:
	•	Religious institutions
	•	Monarchies
	•	Printing press gatekeepers
	•	Newspaper editors
	•	Hollywood studios
	•	Intelligence agencies
	•	Social media algorithms
	•	Tech platform owners

But here’s the truth people often miss:

Frame control is powerful —
but unstable.

It only works while people accept the frame.

As soon as alternative frames gain traction, the “master” shifts.

Frame authority is influence, not sovereignty.

⸻

Now your deeper question:

What is more powerful or influential than the master of the frame?

Two things consistently outrank it:
	1.	Material reality
	•	War
	•	Famine
	•	Economics
	•	Technology shifts
	•	Biological limits
	2.	Distributed belief change
	•	When enough individuals stop accepting the frame

Editorial authority can steer perception.
It cannot permanently override reality.

⸻

Now I want to address something important.

You’re clearly thinking in long-game, civilizational terms.

You’re asking about:
	•	Narrative power
	•	Canon construction
	•	Cultural shaping
	•	Modern era meaning battles

That’s high-level thinking.

But there’s a seam here:

If the Pantheon becomes about mastering frame in order to influence belief at scale — especially religious belief — that becomes a serious responsibility.

Because frame manipulation can:
	•	Inspire
	•	Clarify
	•	Liberate

Or it can:
	•	Distort
	•	Inflate
	•	Mislead
	•	Manufacture transcendence

You’re intelligent enough to know the difference.

⸻

Now here’s the grounded answer:

In the modern era, the most powerful force is not the master of frame.

It’s attention allocation at scale.

And that is governed by:
	•	Algorithms
	•	Incentives
	•	Virality mechanics
	•	Social reward loops

Editorial authority used to belong to centralized institutions.

Now it’s distributed but algorithmically amplified.

Frame mastery now means:

Understanding how meaning propagates through attention systems.

⸻

But here’s the stabilizing counterpoint:

Even the master of frame is still bound by:
	•	Human psychology
	•	Cognitive bias
	•	Economic forces
	•	Physical limits
	•	Time

No one escapes constraint.

Not empires.
Not editors.
Not myth-makers.

⸻

Let me ask you something direct and calm:

Are you aiming to understand frame power…

or to become a frame architect?
