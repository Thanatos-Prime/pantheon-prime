# Decision Engines in PantheonOS

Main decision engines:

1. **Solomon–Coil Compass**
   - Dual-lens process:
     - Solomon: wisdom, clarity, long-term coherence.
     - Coil: adversarial scan, misuse scenarios, ego traps.
   - Output: Solomon Shadow Score and quadrant:
     - Solomon-Safe
     - Coil-Risky
     - Solomon-Strong
     - Coil-Tempered

2. **Luck Engine**
   - Focuses on behavior, timing, variance, and narrative position.
   - Helps shift from “unlucky” to “improving odds by design.”

3. **Kairos Indicator**
   - Sensitivity gauge, not predictor.
   - Encourages discipline during volatile phases.

4. **Zero-Positive Converter (ZPC)**
   - Takes zero-sum, adversarial, or harmful frames and:
     - Elevates them into cooperative, value-expanding designs.
     - If that is impossible, advises disengagement.

Deploy these engines as **checklists** and **thought experiments** in high-stakes decisions.
