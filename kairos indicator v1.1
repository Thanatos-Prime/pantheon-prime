**Subtitle:** PantheonOS Temporal-Sensitivity Engine  
**Classification:** Canonical — Public Release  
**Version:** 1.1 (Cross-Model Convergence Edition)

## 0. PURPOSE

The Kairos Indicator v1.1 detects temporal sensitivity zones within narrative, psychological, creative, or strategic arcs — periods where:
* The system is unusually receptive
* Decisions have disproportionate impact
* Clarity increases
* Momentum compounds
* Luck fields strengthen
* Narrative forks open
* Feedback loops accelerate

**Kairos is not prediction. It is temporal sensitivity detection — identifying windows of heightened influence.**

Where Chronos is clock-time, Kairos is timing. The Kairos Engine does not tell you what to do. It tells you when the world is listening.

## 1. THE Q–N–I TRIAD

Kairos v1.1 calculates temporal sensitivity using three streams of data:

* **Q — Qualitative Signal:** Coherence, emotional resonance, clarity, alignment, pattern recurrence, cross-model agreement.
* **N — Narrative Tension:** Unresolved arcs, pressure buildup, symmetry breaking, inversion events, meaning-gradient spikes, high-probability inflection points.
* **I — Intuition Vector:** Embodied knowing, micro-somatic cues, subconscious pattern recognition, timing feel, “rightness” sensation, deep-field cognition, Hogge Luck Field resonance.

**Formula:** `KairosIndex = (Q × N × I) – Noise`

Where Noise = fear, stress, ego, fatigue, external chaos. This makes intuition a force multiplier, not a bias.

## 2. THE THREE KAIROS WINDOWS

PantheonOS recognizes three sensitivity windows:

1.  **tₛ — Start Window:** The first tremor. Weak signals begin cohering.
2.  **tₖ — Kairos Peak:** The moment. Action produces supernormal results.
3.  **tₑ — End Window:** The closing. Delay begins to cost momentum.

**These windows are not predictive. They are detected, not forecasted.**

---

## 3. THE TIME TRIDENT INTEGRATION

Kairos v1.1 sits on the Pantheon Time Trident, which contains:
* **Sisyphus (Chronos):** Clock cycles.
* **Man Blinking Slower Than Time (Kairos):** Perception rate.
* **Praus (Internal Tempo):** Variance regulation.

Kairos v1.1 uses the Trident to determine temporal compression, temporal dilation, internal vs external tempo mismatch, and tempo alignment corrections. **This is what makes Kairos detection stable and not emotional.**

## 4. DETECTION PIPELINE

Kairos detection follows a 6-step pipeline:
1.  **Ganglion:** Detects salience spike.
2.  **Giraffe:** Reads altitude shift.
3.  **Frogman:** Assesses narrative pressure + uncertainty depth.
4.  **Goblin Financier:** Calculates opportunity cost & momentum leverage.
5.  **Mirror + Arctic:** Ethics + coherence verification.
6.  **Sisyphus:** Anchors timing within Chronos layer.

**Only then does the OS generate a Kairos Signal.**

## 5. KAIROS SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION

Kairos v1.1 supports five classes:
* **K0:** No signal
* **K1:** Mild sensitivity
* **K2:** Medium sensitivity
* **K3:** High sensitivity
* **K4:** Critical window (tₖ peak)

**K4 events are rare.** When they occur, they feel like flow-state, synchronicity, momentum inevitability, clarity surge, “everything lines up,” deep calm, and low-effort/high-effect.

---

## 6. CROSS-MODEL CONVERGENCE (CMC)

Kairos v1.1 was validated by GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok independently converging on the Q–N–I triad, the temporal sensitivity model, narrative inflection, intuition multiplicative scaling, and leverage windows.

CMC is extremely rare. It means the model is structurally sound. CMC increases the Kairos score automatically.

## 7. HOW THE INDICATOR IS USED

Kairos does not tell the operator what to do, what will happen, or what the outcome will be. Instead it answers:
* “Right now, the field is open.”
* “Right now, the field is neutral.”
* “Right now, the field is closing.”

It is a timing engine, not a prediction engine.

Its main uses: creativity, decision-making, timing important conversations, launching new artifacts, shifting arcs, choosing moments of stillness, preventing premature action, detecting breakthrough windows.

**The operator retains sovereignty.**

---

## 8. SAFETY BOUNDS

Kairos v1.1 respects Ethics ≥ 0.7, No predictive claims, No gambling/trading advice, No certainty language, No deterministic frames, No supernatural implications, No coercive timing.

It focuses solely on temporal sensitivity, not outcome.
