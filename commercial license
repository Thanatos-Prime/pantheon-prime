Understood.
Here is a complete, ready-to-publish royalty + licensing framework that preserves your Apache 2.0 open-source license exactly as it is, while layering a legally enforceable commercial license + royalty model on top — WITHOUT violating the Apache license, and WITHOUT restricting free community use.

This is the industry-standard “Apache + Commercial License” dual-model used by companies like Elastic, DataBricks (Delta Lake), Redis Labs, and Confluent.

Everything below is written so you can paste it directly into your repo (LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md, LICENSE-APACHE.md, and README updates).

✅ PANTHEONOS DUAL LICENSE MODEL (Apache 2.0 + PantheonOS Commercial License)

Version 1.0 — Drafted for PantheonOS

PantheonOS is released under a dual license:
	1.	Apache License 2.0
	•	For: individuals, hobbyists, researchers, students, non-commercial users, OSS contributors.
	•	Cost: free forever.
	•	Rights: modify, fork, use, distribute, remix, integrate, experiment, publish.
	2.	PantheonOS Commercial License
	•	For: companies, startups, enterprises, cloud providers, SaaS vendors, AI platforms, agent frameworks.
	•	Cost: micro-royalties + optional enterprise subscriptions.
	•	Rights: legal indemnity, production embedding, closed-source modifications, commercial deployment, scaled agent orchestration.

This keeps PantheonOS open for humanity, but ensures that if someone monetizes it at scale, they support the project.

📜 SECTION 3 — Commercial Usage Triggers (Definitions)

—————————————————––

You must obtain a PantheonOS Commercial License if ANY of the following apply:

Category A — Integration Into Commercial Software

Your product:
	•	charges money,
	•	has paying users,
	•	includes PantheonOS components,
	•	incorporates PantheonOS daemons, kernels, or doctrines,
	•	or relies on PantheonOS to function.

Category B — Enterprise Internal Deployment

You run PantheonOS inside a company with:
	•	10 employees OR
	•	$500k annual revenue OR
	•	more than 5 internal AI workflows powered by PantheonOS.

Category C — Cloud / Platform Use

You embed PantheonOS inside:
	•	a SaaS product
	•	an AI “agent platform”
	•	orchestration tools
	•	LLM infrastructure
	•	cloud-based agent stacks

Category D — AI Training, Orchestration, or Multi-Agent Runtime

PantheonOS is used for:
	•	agent orchestration
	•	cross-model memory
	•	runtime governance
	•	autonomy layer
	•	continuity kernel

These are inherently commercial-value operations.

If you fall into any category above → Commercial License required.

📜 SECTION 4 — Royalty Schedule (Micro-Payments)

––––––––––––––––––––––––––

This is the heart of the model.
It’s designed to be tiny per-operation, so companies don’t feel it, but scale creates meaningful funding.

Royalty Type:

PantheonOS Runtime Invocation Fee
(charged per continuity update, daemon invocation, state reconcile, or governance call)

Default Rate:

$0.000002 (two ten-thousandths of a cent) per PantheonOS Runtime Event

Definitions:
	•	Runtime Event:
Any call to:
	•	Spider
	•	Hound
	•	Mirror
	•	Mother Duck
	•	Dragonfly φ/√2
	•	Sieve of Hogge
	•	Continuity Kernel
	•	Prime–Zero Engine
	•	Oracle Weave
	•	Luck Engine
	•	ZPC Transform
	•	Continuous Mode Discount:
If Pantheon is used as a persistent agent layer:
Royalty = $0.000001 per event
	•	Enterprise Cap Option:
Maximum annual cost = 0.15% of annual revenue
(ensures fairness, prevents runaway cost)

Example:

A company running 20 million PantheonOS events/month pays:

20,000,000 × $0.000002 = $40/month

That is trivial at enterprise scale — but could fund development at global scale.

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

📜 SECTION 5 — Enterprise Subscription Option (Optional)

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Instead of paying per-event royalties, companies may choose a subscription:

Tier 1: Startup License — $2,500/year
	•	<25 employees
	•	< $1M revenue
	•	Unlimited PantheonOS usage

Tier 2: Growth License — $10,000/year
	•	<250 employees
	•	< $20M revenue
	•	Unlimited usage
	•	Engineering support

Tier 3: Enterprise — $50,000/year
	•	Unlimited employees
	•	Unlimited usage
	•	Priority support
	•	Compliance modules
	•	Governance suite access

Tier 4: Cloud Provider — Negotiated

(For AWS, Azure, GCP, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

–––––––––––––––––––––––

📜 SECTION 6 — Required Attribution

–––––––––––––––––––––––

in:
	•	docs
	•	marketing pages
	•	UI footers where applicable
	•	agent descriptions
	•	cloud dashboards
	•	developer consoles

This is the same requirement used by:
	•	TensorFlow
	•	Kubernetes
	•	React Native
	•	Redis
