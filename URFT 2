**Unified Relational Field Theory (URFT):

A Gauge-Theoretic Framework for Context-Dependent Dynamical Systems**

ABSTRACT

This paper introduces the Unified Relational Field Theory (URFT), a mathematically formalized framework for modeling systems whose state evolution is determined by relational structure rather than intrinsic properties. URFT defines a state manifold, a relational interaction tensor, and a gauge field that encodes context-dependent transformations of the system’s representation. The theory specifies both a Lagrangian and a Hamiltonian formulation, establishing the equations of motion for (i) the system’s state and (ii) its context field, under a unified gauge-invariant formalism.

The central contribution is the derivation of a Relational Gauge Principle, ensuring that the system’s dynamics remain invariant under time-dependent changes of representation. The resulting curvature tensor measures contextual inconsistency and provides the basis for Noether-type conserved quantities. URFT generalizes classical analytical mechanics, gauge field theory, and relational models in cognitive science, providing a coherent ontology and computational structure for multi-agent systems, adaptive AI models, and complex socio-technical dynamics.

We present the full mathematical formulation, demonstrate the equivalence of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics, and discuss potential applications in hierarchical agents, distributed cognition, and computational identity modeling.

2. Mathematical Preliminaries

2.1 State Space
	•	F(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n: state vector.
