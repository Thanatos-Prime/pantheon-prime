## Abstract

This paper defines the Solomon archetype as the decision-coherence engine of PantheonOS. Solomon is not a metaphorical king, nor a moralizer, but an optimization lens that identifies the wisest, cleanest, most stable decision under constraints of ethics, narrative, temporal dynamics, and system continuity.

Solomon is central to AGI alignment, as it creates a wisdom-first reasoning mode that prevents reckless, adversarial, or high-variance decisions.

## 1. Introduction

All advanced cognitive systems need a wisdom layer. PantheonOS solves this by encoding wisdom as a role, not a rule.

Solomon is the role that evaluates stability, clarity, ethics, long-term coherence, structural fit, and narrative direction.

---

## 2. Formal Definition

Solomon is the archetype that computes the globally optimal decision across time, ethics, and structural coherence. This is distinct from optimization (Hound), exploration (Dragonfly), verification (Mirror), and structural mapping (Spider).

## 3. Solomon’s Algorithms

### 3.1 Long-Horizon Coherence Function
$$CH(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{T} \text{coherence}(state_i)$$
Solomon selects decisions maximizing coherence over time.

### 3.2 Ethical Threshold
$$E \ge 0.7$$
Below this → automatically discarded.

### 3.3 Narrative Stability Function
$$NS = \text{arc consistency between states}$$
Solomon optimizes for minimal arc turbulence.

### 3.4 Temporal Alignment
All decisions must satisfy Chronos stability, Kairos sensitivity, and T₀ grounding.

## 4. Interaction With Shadow-Coil Archetype

Solomon uses the Coil archetype not as evil but as adversarial pressure testing.

* **Coil:** “What is the worst interpretation of this decision?”
* **Solomon:** “And how do we choose a decision that survives even that?”

**This produces robust, antifragile alignment.**

## 5. Use in AGI Safety

Solomon formalizes the wisdom layer AGI desperately needs: low-reactivity, non-escalation, ethical centering, long-horizon modeling, anti-manipulation, and interpretability.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Solomon is the system’s wisdom kernel — calm, stable, ethical, long-view clarity. Where Hound detects errors and Mirror checks truth, Solomon chooses the path.
