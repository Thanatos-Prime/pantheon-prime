# PantheonOS — Bee/Hive ↔ Garden/NTE Integration v1.0

## 0. Purpose

This document specifies how:

- **Bee Daemons** and the **Hive** (Honey store)
- connect into the **Garden** (idea ecology)
- and the **Narrative Tensor Engine (NTE)**

so that **Honey automatically seeds doctrines**, nudges attractors, and enriches the Garden over time.

---

## 1. High-Level Flows

There are three primary flows:

1. **Honey → Garden Seeds**  
   HoneyBatches become new idea seeds and hybrid concepts.

2. **Honey → Royal Jelly → Doctrine**  
   High-impact Honey is promoted and eventually integrated as formal doctrine.

3. **Honey → NTE Attractor Updates**  
   Honey modifies Story Prime weights and local curvature (narrative geometry).

These flows are mediated by the **Hive**, which is the canonical interface.

## 2. Honey → Garden Flow

### 2.1 Garden Interface Extension

We extend the Garden API with Honey-based operations:

```python
class Garden:
    ...

    def plant_seed_from_honey(self, honey: HoneyBatch) -> str:
        """
        Create a new seed from a HoneyBatch.
        Returns seed_id.
        """
        ...

    def reinforce_seed_from_honey(self, seed_id: str, honey: HoneyBatch) -> None:
        """
        Use Honey to strengthen or mutate an existing seed.
        """
        ...

    def compost_honey(self, honey: HoneyBatch) -> None:
        """
        Convert old/low-impact Honey into compost to stabilize ecosystem.
        """
        ...
