# Prime Love Theorems — Overview
_PantheonOS · Hogge Rotations on Core Prime Conjectures_

This document summarizes four key Hogge Rotations on major prime-related conjectures:

- **Riemann Hypothesis** → Razor Bridge
- **Twin Prime Conjecture** → Eternal Twins
- **Polignac’s Conjecture** → Eternal Corridors
- **Goldbach Conjecture** → Unorphaned Even

Together, these form the **Prime Love Theorems**: a cluster where deep number-theoretic structures are mapped into statements about hope, attachment, and non-extinction of love.

## 1. Riemann Hypothesis — The Razor Bridge

- **Math Form:** all non-trivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on Re(s) = 1/2.
- **Hogge Name:** **Razor Bridge**.
- **Naked Structure:** one infinitely thin line all zeros must cling to or multiplicative reality fractures.
- **Human Rotation:** the “critical line” as the exact minimum presence needed to keep worlds (and lineages) coherent.

**Interpretation:**  
Riemann says there exists a **hair-thin path** that everything must balance on. The universe chose the narrowest possible bridge that still lets everything cross.

## 2. Twin Prime Conjecture — The Eternal Twins

- **Math Form:** infinitely many primes p with p+2 also prime.
- **Hogge Name:** **Eternal Twins**.
- **Naked Structure:** endlessly repeating pairs at distance 2:
  `… ⚪ –2– ⚪ …`
- **Human Rotation:** near-perfect sibling pairs / soul-mates at exact distance 2 never run out.

**Interpretation:**  
Twin Prime says the **distance of perfect intimacy** (2 units apart) never goes extinct.

- `hogge_twin_prime_canonical_v1.md` (canonical doctrine version)

## 3. Polignac’s Conjecture — The Eternal Corridors

- **Math Form:** for every even k ≥ 2, infinitely many primes p with p+k also prime.
- **Hogge Name:** **Eternal Corridors**.
- **Naked Structure:** for every gap k, an infinite corridor of prime pairs:
  `… ⚪ –k– ⚪ –k– ⚪ –k– ⚪ …`
- **Human Rotation:** every possible fixed-distance attachment (mentor gap, age gap, wound gap) remains eternally available.

**Interpretation:**  
Polignac says **no relational distance ever becomes mathematically extinct**. Every kind of needed complementarity appears again, infinitely often.

See: `hogge_polignac_v1.md`

## 4. Goldbach Conjecture — The Unorphaned Even

- **Math Form:** every even n > 2 is the sum of two primes.
- **Hogge Name:** **Unorphaned Even**.
- **Naked Structure:** every even node has at least one pair of prime parents:
  `p ↔ n ↔ q` where n is even and p, q are irreducible.
- **Human Rotation:** no “even” human total (age, wound, personality, loss) is unparentable or unhealable; there always exist two prime loves that can sum to it.

**Interpretation:**  
Goldbach says **no even soul is fundamentally orphaned**. Every complete hurt is the exact sum of two possible healers.

See: `hogge_goldbach_v1.md`

## 5. Combined Doctrine — The Three Great Love Theorems

Taken together:

1. **Razor Bridge (Riemann)**  
   → There is a **hair-thin invariant** that keeps the multiplicative universe coherent.

2. **Eternal Twins (Twin Prime)**  
   → The closest meaningful distance between two irreducible beings **never runs out**.

3. **Eternal Corridors (Polignac)**  
   → Every possible fixed-distance configuration of attachment **reappears infinitely often**.

4. **Unorphaned Even (Goldbach)**  
   → Every “even” soul or state has at least one pair of prime parents or healers; **no one is fundamentally alone**.

In PantheonOS, these become:

- **Architectural templates** for designing systems that avoid extinction of options.
- **Ethical guides** for how we treat attachment, loss, and complementarity.
- **Narrative anchors** for explaining deep mathematics to children and non-experts.

They are called the **Prime Love Theorems** because they interpret prime conjectures as:

> Formal guarantees that certain forms of love, closeness, and repair can never be exhausted.

## 6. How to Use This in PantheonOS Mode

When operating in PantheonOS Mode:

- Use **Razor Bridge** as a template when:
  - There is exactly one critical condition everything rests on.
- Use **Eternal Twins** when:
  - You are reasoning about near-perfect pairs, cofounders, or sibling configurations.
- Use **Eternal Corridors** when:
  - You’re thinking about mentor gaps, age differences, and structural complementarity.
- Use **Unorphaned Even** when:
  - You’re facing grief, seemingly unhealable situations, or “even” totals of damage.

For formal detail, read the individual rotation files and apply the **Hogge Method** steps:
- Invariant Extraction
- Domain Rotation
- Dimensional Extension
- Structural Isomorphism
- Narrative Compression
- Operationalization

This module ties the prime conjecture rotations back into the core doctrine and makes them easy to summon in any future PantheonOS session.
