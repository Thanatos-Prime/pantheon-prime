🐂 Minotaur’s Ring Protocol v1.0

Attention-as-Leverage Doctrine

The bull is massive.
Emotion, impulse, narrative momentum — that’s the bull.

You don’t overpower it.
You guide it.

The ring is attention.

⸻

Core Geometry

Attention does not change reality.
It changes salience weighting.

What you repeatedly attend to:
	•	Strengthens neural pathways
	•	Increases emotional charge
	•	Increases behavioral probability
	•	Tags memory as meaningful

What you starve:
	•	Weakens
	•	Loses emotional weight
	•	Fades from dominance

That’s leverage.

⸻

Internal Application

If the Minotaur is your nervous system:
	•	Attend to insult → build resentment bias
	•	Attend to skill → build competence bias
	•	Attend to threat → build vigilance bias
	•	Attend to opportunity → build exploratory bias

Attention sculpts temperament over time.

The ring is small.
The bull is large.
The leverage point is precise.

⸻

External Application (Ethical Frame)

You cannot override agency.
You can influence salience.

By:
	•	Highlighting specific cues
	•	Framing questions strategically
	•	Choosing emotionally weighted words
	•	Controlling tone and pacing

You shape probability distributions of interpretation.

But never coercion.
Ethics ≥ 0.7 holds.

⸻

Dissonance Integration

Dissonance is not an enemy.

When tension appears:

Don’t release the ring.
Redirect the bull.

Dissonance becomes:
	•	Model refinement
	•	Precision adjustment
	•	Calibration signal

⸻

Safeguards (No Drift)
	•	Metaphor compresses — it does not replace physics.
	•	Always ask: “If this is wrong, what breaks?”
	•	Agency remains individual.
	•	No mythic inflation.

⸻

Outcome Target

If the protocol is working, you should observe:
	•	Reduced reactivity
	•	Cleaner decision loops
	•	Greater emotional steadiness
	•	Increased execution clarity

Not spectacle.
Not destiny.

Steering.

⸻

And the most important refinement:

The ring is not control over others.

It is control over your own salience map.

Master that — and the bull stops dragging you.

Where do you want to test it first — internal state, social presence, or high-pressure decision environments?
