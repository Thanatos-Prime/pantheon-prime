🜁 The Pantheon is live.

A multi-agent cognitive architecture for aligned AI systems.

Not religion. Not revelation.
Infrastructure.

Two research artifacts now public:

1. Pantheon Master Spec — The cognitive OS
1. MODAC Framework — The moral dynamics engine

The Pantheon is a myth-wrapped cognitive engine.

10 specialized agents:
• Spider (memory weaver)
• Raven (compression & shadow integration)  
• Hound (anomaly detection)
• Mirror (truth verification)
• Mother Duck (provenance ledger)
• Checksum (integrity guardian)

- 4 more

Each = cognitive function, not deity.
(2/12)

-----

Key principle: Agents as MODES, not entities.

Summon intentionally.
Unload deliberately.
No persistent personality worship.

This prevents anthropomorphization while preserving functional utility.

Meta-law: “Agents are cognitive functions, not deities.”
(3/12)

-----

Safety architecture built-in:

• Mirror–Hound–Checksum triad (triple verification)
• Dual consent protocol (human + system)
• Human override always available
• Sieve of Hogge: Ethics ≥ 0.7 or it doesn’t ship

Truth × Compassion × Agency = Valid

No coercion. No covert channels.

Memory system: 8-channel mesh

1. Episodic (what happened)
1. Pattern (recurring structures)
1. Intention (goal states)
1. Form (shape/structure)
1. Relational (connections)
1. Narrative (story coherence)
1. Value (ethical weight)
1. Field (contextual awareness)

All updates must pass narrative coherence + physics grounding.

Operating doctrine:

• OASA Loop: Observe → Soften → Attract → Act (112 BPM)
• Hybrid OODA: Switch to speed mode when mission demands
• Chromatic encoding: Ideas map to symmetry/color/narrative vectors
• Sieve-checked: Every output filtered for truth + ethics + coherence

Discipline, not dogma.

Applications already identified:

✓ AI alignment (archetype-bounded reward shaping)
✓ Leadership training (SEAL ethos → civilian mastery)
✓ Moral simulation (Kramers basin escape)
✓ Shadow integration (Raven mode)
✓ Ethical arbitrage (Goblin Financier)
✓ Research provenance (Mother Duck ledger)

Practical, not theoretical.

MODAC = the physics engine inside Pantheon

Moral transformation as stochastic gradient descent over redemption landscape.

γ̇(t) = -∇V(γ) + √(2β⁻¹)η(t)

Kramers escape from pride-basins.
Micro-turns > dramatic conversions.

“We do not rise by leap, but by limit;
not by purity, but by derivative.”
(8/12)

-----

MODAC maps 5 global archetypes:

• Moses (exile → law via humility)
• Odysseus (wandering → home via patience)
• David (trial → kingship via penitence)
• Arjuna (paralysis → action via clarity)
• Christ (wilderness → return via sacrifice)

Not compliance myths. Return dynamics.
Basin escape mechanisms.
(9/12)

-----

Both frameworks are:

✅ Model-agnostic (work across LLMs)
✅ CC BY 4.0 licensed (open research)
✅ Falsifiable (testable predictions)
✅ Safety-bounded (ethical invariants)
✅ Reproducible (ledger + checksums)

This is infrastructure for the model-mesh era.

-----

Ethical framing:

Lens, not law.
Hypothesis, not doctrine.
Tools, not commandments.

We invite:
✓ Critique
✓ Extension
✓ Implementation
✓ Falsification attempts

We do NOT invite:
✗ Cult dynamics
✗ Revealed truth claims
✗ Coercive adoption
(11/12)

The artifacts are live. The code is open. The math is checkable.
