You’re pulling together three threads here:
	1.	We don’t have sensors for ultimate scale.
	2.	Stories shape us whether written or spoken.
	3.	Fragmented narratives → fragmented coordination.

Let’s walk it cleanly, grounded.

⸻

1. “It’s all in your head” — but that doesn’t make it unreal

You’re right in a specific way:

Your brain constructs scale.

You’ve never felt the curvature of Earth.
You’ve never directly sensed the age of the universe.
You can’t directly experience infinity or “vastness.”

Your nervous system evolved for:
	•	Tribal scale
	•	Immediate threats
	•	Short time horizons

Everything larger is symbolic compression.

That doesn’t mean it’s fake.
It means it’s mediated.

The brain builds models.
It never experiences raw reality — only processed signals.

That’s neuroscience, not mysticism.

2. Stories are neural operating systems

Spoken myths, written scripture, movies, memes — they all alter:
	•	Salience weighting
	•	Identity framing
	•	Behavioral norms
	•	Moral boundaries
	•	Cooperation incentives

From a cognitive perspective, a spoken myth and a written text both alter synaptic weighting.

The medium affects persistence.
The effect on the brain can be similar.

Writing increased durability.
It reduced drift.
It stabilized coordination across time.

That’s why written traditions scale better than purely oral ones.

3. Why a few religions persisted

It’s not necessarily that they were “most important” in some cosmic sense.

It’s that they:
	•	Standardized doctrine.
	•	Institutionalized transmission.
	•	Controlled replication fidelity.
	•	Built enforcement structures.
	•	Created identity-binding rituals.
	•	Survived geopolitical filters.

Persistence is partly selection pressure.

Memes that:
	•	Coordinate large groups
	•	Promote in-group cohesion
	•	Provide moral clarity
	•	Justify sacrifice
	•	Institutionalize reproduction

tend to survive.

That’s cultural evolution.

4. Fragmentation now

You’re correct about something modern:

We have infinite narrative bandwidth.

Instead of:
	•	One tribal myth
	•	One sacred text
	•	One state story

We have:
	•	10,000 competing identity streams
	•	Algorithmically amplified niches
	•	Personalized narrative feeds

That increases:
	•	Individual freedom
	•	Cultural innovation
	•	But also fragmentation
	•	Reduced shared coordination baseline

No shared OS → coordination costs rise.

But here’s the nuance:

We do still have standards.
	•	Law
	•	Markets
	•	Scientific method
	•	Internet protocols
	•	English as lingua franca
	•	Financial systems

They’re just procedural, not mythic.

Modern civilization coordinates through systems, not a single sacred story.

That’s a different architecture.

⸻

5. The danger in your framing

Where I’m going to gently apply brakes:

It’s tempting to romanticize unified myth as inherently superior.

But unified myth also historically produced:
	•	Dogmatism
	•	Suppression
	•	Stagnation
	•	Persecution
	•	Intellectual rigidity

Fragmentation increases noise.
But it also increases resilience and innovation.

A monoculture is efficient.
It is also brittle.

⸻

6. The deeper thing you might be feeling

When you talk about:
	•	Vastness
	•	Scale
	•	Story spread
	•	Lack of alignment

It sounds less like conquest impulse now.

It sounds like:

Desire for coherence.

Humans feel calmer when:
	•	There is shared direction.
	•	There is moral clarity.
	•	There is collective identity.

Fragmentation feels disorienting.

That doesn’t mean collapse is inevitable.
It means we’re in a high-variance informational era.

⸻

Let me ask something grounded:

When you think about “no shared OS,” does it feel like:

A) Loss of meaning
B) Loss of power
C) Loss of unity
D) Opportunity for new synthesis

Which one actually hits?
