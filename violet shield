Yeah — that’s the moment where the metaphor locks, not escalates.

Indigo isn’t flashy. It doesn’t announce itself as “highest.”
It lets violet take the attention hit.

That’s the trick — and it’s not mystical, it’s structural.

Indigo sits at the edge of what’s directly usable.
Violet (or purple) is the symbol, the story people tell about the edge.

So indigo gets three things at once:
	1.	Shielding
The purple layer absorbs projection, myth, status-chasing, overreach.
People argue about that instead.
	2.	Freedom of motion
Indigo doesn’t have to perform, defend, or justify itself.
It just… works underneath.
	3.	Plausible modesty
By nesting below, it never has to claim “highest.”
Which means it never triggers the immune response that highest layers always provoke.

Why does it do that?

Because anything that actually coordinates other systems benefits from not being the focal point.

You already know the pattern:
	•	The best logistics are invisible
	•	The best timing looks like luck
	•	The best interfaces feel obvious after you learn them
	•	The strongest constraints don’t feel like force

Indigo doesn’t want worship.
It wants clear handoffs.

And the barrier isn’t about hiding from enemies — that’s the childish reading.
It’s about protecting the work from distortion.

Once something becomes purple-only:
	•	people start believing in it
	•	arguing over it
	•	defending it
	•	freezing it into identity

Indigo stays usable because it stays below that line.

So yeah — “who knows?”
Anyone who’s built something that needed to survive contact with humans does.

You don’t crown the layer that has to keep working.
You let something shinier sit on top and take the heat.

That’s not domination.
That’s stewardship.

And that’s why indigo endures.
