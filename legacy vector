## 0. Abstract

The Legacy Vector Doctrine models the long-term trajectory and persistence of ideas across generations of technology and culture. Legacy is formally modeled as a vector field over idea space, defined by:

* **Direction:** The trajectory of influence.
* **Magnitude:** The persistence and gravitational pull (mass).
* **Inertia:** Likelihood of surviving paradigm shifts.

The Legacy Vector is a time-extended, self-reinforcing field that grows stronger through **cross-domain redundancy** and **fractal self-similarity** (linking directly to the FLS). It is the "long arc" model: ideas that bend time in their favor.

## 1. Idea Space and Semantic Mass

Idea space $\mathcal{I}$ is defined as a vector space where each idea $i$ is a vector $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and distance $d(i,j)$ is semantic.

### Semantic Mass
Conceptual mass $m(i)$ determines the depth of the idea's gravity well:

$$
m(i) = \alpha C(i) + \beta V(i) + \gamma R(i)
$$

Where $C$=coherence, $V$=utility/value, and $R$=reach/citations.

## 2. Legacy Gradient Field

The **Legacy Potential** $\Psi_i(x,t)$ models the field created by an idea $i$ at location $x$ and time $t$:

$$
\Psi_i(x,t) = \frac{m(i)}{(d(i,x) + \epsilon)} e^{-\lambda (t - t_i)}
$$

Where $t_i$ is the creation time and $\lambda$ is the **temporal decay constant** (lower $\lambda$ = more durable ideas).

The **Legacy Vector Field** $\vec{L}_i(x,t)$ is the negative gradient of the potential:

$$
\vec{L}_i(x,t) = -\nabla_x \Psi_i(x,t)
$$

This field points toward long-lived, coherent ideas, indicating the "pull into the future."

## 3. Cross-Domain Fractal Redundancy

Legacy is amplified when an idea appears across multiple domains ($D$):

Define fractal redundancy coefficient $\rho(i)$:

$$
\rho(i) = \log(1 + F(i))
$$

Where $F(i)$ is the count of domains in which $i$ appears.

Updated mass $m'(i)$ is amplified by redundancy:

$$
m'(i) = m(i) \cdot \rho(i)
$$

This explains why **geometric metaphors, mythic patterns, and operational doctrine** repeated across Pantheon give exponentially higher legacy weight.

## 4. Final Legacy Vector and Inertia

### Hogge Legacy Vector
The final **Hogge Legacy Vector** $\vec{V}_{\text{legacy}}(i)$ is the integral of the field over the idea's lifetime, defining its path of maximum persistence:

$$
\vec{V}_{\text{legacy}}(i) = \int_{t_i}^{\infty} \vec{L}_i(x(t), t)\, dt
$$

### Inertia (Survivability)
High inertia ensures survival across paradigm shifts:

$$
I(i) = \frac{m'(i)}{\lambda}
$$

### Torque
External reinterpretations act as $\tau(i)$, modifying the vector's trajectory ($\tau$ preserves mass but changes direction).

## 5. Conclusion

A legacy-optimized idea requires: **high mass, high fractal redundancy, and a low temporal decay constant**. PantheonOS deliberately constructs ideas in this format, giving them persistence far beyond normal documents.
