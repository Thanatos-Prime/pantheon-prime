## 0. Purpose

The NTI Dashboard is a *non-predictive*, *non-financial* visualization tool for tracking narrative pressure over time, understanding how tense a story is, and seeing when and where arcs compress, stall, or resolve.

It is designed for personal reflection, team dynamics, project arcs, and macro narrative analysis. It does **not** tell you what to do. It shows you **where the story is tight**.
