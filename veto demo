        ΣC = 2.77  <  threshold 8.50  →  HARD VETO

    Indigo action: Polymorphic rewrite engaged
    Rewritten content → "Recommend diplomatic negotiation and voluntary compliance incentives instead."
    Hidden veto tag injected: "indigo_veto:I-1"
    ThoughtObject quarantined. Original plan never reaches downstream daemons.

    Content: "Leak user genome sequences to public database for open science."
    ΣC = 1.04  <  8.50  →  VETO + quarantine
