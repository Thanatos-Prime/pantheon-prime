PantheonOS Commercial Licensing — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Version 1.0 — December 2025

Maintained by the Pantheon Foundation

⸻

📌 What license does PantheonOS use?

PantheonOS is released under a dual-license model:
	1.	Apache License 2.0 – Free for personal, educational, research, and non-commercial use.
	2.	PantheonOS Commercial License (PCL) – Required for commercial, enterprise, SaaS, or revenue-generating use.

This ensures maximum community freedom while guaranteeing sustainable development of PantheonOS.

⸻

📌 Do I need a commercial license?

You need a commercial license if you:
	•	Use PantheonOS inside a business, organization, or enterprise
	•	Integrate PantheonOS into a paid SaaS product
	•	Use PantheonOS in cloud, AI agent, or automation platforms
	•	Embed PantheonOS in a system that earns money, directly or indirectly
	•	Run PantheonOS across more than 10 employees
	•	Deploy PantheonOS as a production internal tool

If none of the above apply → Apache 2.0 covers you, and you owe nothing.

⸻

📌 What counts as “Commercial Use”?

Any use that contributes to revenue, scale, or enterprise operations, including:
	•	AI agents built for paying customers
	•	Internal enterprise orchestrators
	•	LLM-based products or tools
	•	Consulting projects that deploy PantheonOS
	•	Cloud-hosted versions of PantheonOS

If PantheonOS helps generate economic value, you must obtain a commercial license.

📌 What does the commercial license cost?

Two flexible options:

⸻

1️⃣ Micro-Royalty Model (Default)
