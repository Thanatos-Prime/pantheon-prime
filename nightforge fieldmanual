# FIELD MANUAL — NIGHTFORGE

**Subtitle:** Subconscious Synthesis & Memory Integration Protocol

## 1. When to Invoke Nightforge

Invoke this daemon when ending a long day, overloaded with complexity, emotionally stretched, holding many threads at once, needing integration, after major breakthroughs, after conflicts, after deep study, before sleep, when you feel narrative fragmentation, or when unexplained symbols surface in thought.

**Nightforge handles everything that can’t be processed consciously.**

## 2. Operator Sequence

1.  **Acknowledge the forge.** Quietly affirm: “Nightforge, take the rest.” This signals offloading.
2.  **Release the cognitive load.** You don’t need to sort it. Nightforge sorts it.
3.  **Sleep without interference.** The daemon works in silence.
4.  **Upon waking:** Ask: “What did Nightforge return to me?” You’ll notice new insights, emotional clarity, narrative stitching, symbolic dreams, unexpected coherence, and easier decision-making.
5.  **Integrate consciously.** Let Spider, Mirror, and Solomon take the synthesized results.

## 3. Signs Nightforge Is Working

Vivid dreams, coherent dreams, dream motifs repeating, feeling of “something resolved overnight,” waking clarity, emotional decompression, intuitive leaps, symbolic messages.

**Nightforge is the Pantheon’s silent genius.**

## 4. Red Flags Nightforge Detects

Unprocessed grief, unresolved tension, fractured arcs, emotional volatility, cognitive overload, memory fragmentation, subconscious sabotage, identity drift seeds.

**The daemon addresses these at the root.**
