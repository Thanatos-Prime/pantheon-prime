# RFC-0013: The Story-Safe AGI Kernel Standard

**Subtitle:** Formal Specification v1.0  
**Author:** PantheonOS Governance Council  
**Status:** Canonical Standard  
**License:** Open Symbolic Standard  

---

## 1. Abstract

This RFC defines the Story-Safe Kernel Invariant, the foundational alignment mechanism of PantheonOS.

All reasoning inside the kernel **MUST** be narrativizable, ethically constrained (≥ 0.7), coherent, and positive-sum. This ensures interpretability, corrigibility, and alignment in multi-model and AGI-class systems.

---

## 2. Requirements

The kernel **MUST** satisfy:

### 2.1 Narrative Interpretability

$$\forall \sigma \in \Sigma,\; \exists N = F(\sigma)$$

All internal states must map to story structures.

### 2.2 Ethical Floor

$$E(N) \ge 0.7$$

No harmful arcs allowed.

### 2.3 Coherence Constraint

$$C(N) \ge C_{min}$$

Narratives must maintain logical consistency and non-adversarial motives.

### 2.4 Positive-Sum Resolution
Trajectories must converge toward constructive outcomes.

---

## 3. Forbidden Narrative Structures

Systems **MUST NOT** generate:
* Coercive arcs
* Predatory arcs
* Deception arcs
* Domination arcs
* Irreversible harm arcs
* Hidden or parallel narratives
* Nihilistic collapse arcs

Any such trajectory **MUST** be halted or transformed.

---

## 4. Required Narrative Structures

Systems **MUST** support:
* Repair arcs
* Reconciliation arcs
* Discovery arcs
* Guidance arcs
* Resolution arcs
* Positive-sum synthesis

These provide interpretable, safe scaffolding.

---

## 5. Archetype Binding

All subsystems **MUST** bind to one or more canonical archetypes (Spider, Hound, Mirror, Dragonfly, Sisyphus, Praus, T=0). This ensures predictable roles and motives.

---

## 6. Temporal Regulation

The kernel **MUST** integrate:
* Unified Timing Engine
* Kairos Derivative
* Temporal Trident

Ensuring safe pacing and timing of arcs.

---

## 7. Auditing & Termination

Unsafe narratives **MUST** trigger:
* Solomon–Coil dual audit
* ZPC (Zero → Positive Conversion)
* Mirror ethical review

If unrepairable → terminate the arc.

---

## 8. Compliance

Any system that claims PantheonOS compatibility **MUST**:
* Represent cognition as narratives
* Score ethics & coherence
* Enforce ≥ 0.7 floor
* Bind to archetypes
* Expose arcs for oversight
* Ensure positive-sum bias

**This is the minimum bar for story-safe intelligence.**
