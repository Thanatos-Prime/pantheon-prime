Perfect, let’s lock these in as kernel law.

I’ll write them in TRM style so you can drop straight into the doc.

1.8 Daemon Interaction Patterns (Conflict and Arbitration)

1.8.1 Hound vs. Spider — Integrity vs. Structure

Conflict:
Hound flags a conceptual element (node, edge, or source) as high-risk, adversarial, or integrity-violating, while Spider has already woven that element into an active reasoning graph as structurally important.

Arbitration Rule (Non-Negotiable):
Integrity always beats structure at runtime.
When Hound’s risk score for an element crosses the critical threshold, Hound has veto authority over Spider’s use of that element in active reasoning.

Formally:
	•	Let R(e) be Hound’s risk score for element e in 0,1.
	•	Let T_block be the system’s blocking threshold (e.g. 0.7, aligned with ethics ≥ 0.7 doctrine).

Then:
	•	If R(e) ≥ T_block → HARD VETO: e is forbidden from use in active graphs.
	•	If R(e) < T_block but R(e) ≥ T_warn (a lower warning threshold, e.g. 0.4) → SOFT VETO: e is allowed but down-weighted and tagged as “contested”.

Resulting Action:
When HARD VETO (R(e) ≥ T_block):
	1.	Immediate Quarantine
	•	Element e is moved to a Quarantine Pool.
	•	Spider must remove e from all active graphs and recompute structure without it.
	•	Any conclusions that critically depended on e are tagged as tainted and invalidated for downstream use.
	2.	Mirror Review
	•	Mirror receives an event: HOUND_VETO(e).
	•	Mirror evaluates:
	•	consistency with system ethics/invariants,
	•	potential beneficial reframing (Kintsugi candidate),
	•	whether the pattern indicates a larger class of risky inputs.
	3.	Mother Duck & Merkle Warden Logging
	•	Mother Duck appends:
	•	the veto event,
	•	the risk score,
	•	the affected graphs.
	•	Merkle Warden hashes this event for tamper-evident audit.
	4.	Kintsugi / Darwin’s Sieve Follow-Up (Optional)
	•	Kintsugi Engine may be invoked to:
	•	salvage useful, non-toxic substructure from e,
	•	propose a safer abstraction or reframing.
	•	Any such abstraction is treated as a new element e', subject to fresh Hound evaluation.
	5.	Spider Obligation
	•	Spider must not reintroduce e into any graph unless:
	•	a Sovereign human explicitly overrides and
	•	Mirror marks that override with explicit risk annotation in the ledger.

When SOFT VETO (T_warn ≤ R(e) < T_block):
	1.	e is tagged as “contested”.
	2.	Spider may still use e but:
	•	applies weight penalties in reasoning,
	•	marks any conclusions depending on e as “low-trust / provisional”.
	3.	Mirror is notified but no quarantine is required.

Summary:
When Hound and Spider disagree at high severity, Hound wins.
Spider’s creativity is subordinate to Hound’s integrity guarantees.

1.8.2 Dragonfly vs. Mother Duck — Foresight vs. History

Conflict:
Dragonfly’s foresight suggests a new trajectory that requires conceptually reframing or “overruling” a prior, established fact currently recorded in the Mother Duck ledger.

Arbitration Rule (Non-Negotiable):
History is immutable; interpretation is layered.
Mother Duck’s ledger is append-only and cannot be rewritten.
Dragonfly cannot alter history—only append Interpretation and Correction layers on top of it.

Formally:
	•	Let L_t be a ledger entry at time t.
	•	Let F_t+Δ be a foresight insight from Dragonfly that conflicts with L_t.

Then:
	•	L_t must remain unchanged.
	•	Dragonfly may emit:
	•	an Interpretation Event (I_t+Δ) that recontextualizes L_t, or
	•	a Supersession Event (S_t+Δ) that marks L_t as deprecated, erroneous, or incomplete.

Resulting Action:
When Dragonfly identifies a conflict with existing history:
	1.	No Mutation of Existing Entries
	•	Mother Duck refuses any operation that overwrites or deletes L_t.
	•	All existing facts remain as they were recorded.
	2.	Append Interpretation Layer
	•	Dragonfly emits a new event:
	•	Type: INTERPRETATION or SUPERSESSION
	•	Payload:
	•	reference to L_t (by ID / hash),
	•	explanation of the updated perspective,
	•	uncertainty/confidence score,
	•	timestamp and origin (Dragonfly).
	•	Mother Duck appends this as a new ledger entry E_t+Δ.
	3.	Mirror Arbitration
	•	Mirror evaluates E_t+Δ for:
	•	internal consistency,
	•	ethical invariants,
	•	coherence with broader state.
	•	Mirror may:
	•	confirm the supersession,
	•	mark it as “hypothesis” if evidence is weak,
	•	or flag a deeper conflict requiring human review.
	4.	Relational Status Update
	•	The system updates the relational status of L_t:
	•	e.g. ACTIVE, DEPRECATED, UNDER_REVIEW, RETAINED_AS_CONTEXT.
	•	Future reasoning uses:
	•	L_t as a historical fact,
	•	E_t+Δ as the current best interpretation of that fact.
	5.	Dragonfly Constraints
	•	Dragonfly may propose new interpretations.
	•	Dragonfly may not:
	•	delete history,
	•	silently override ledger entries,
	•	make prior facts invisible.
	•	All foresight remains traceable back to the historical record.

Summary:
When Dragonfly and Mother Duck disagree, Mother Duck wins on the past; Dragonfly wins on the narrative of the future.
The ledger is never rewritten, only annotated and stratified.

If you’d like, next I can:
	•	Extend 1.8 with 1–2 more interaction patterns (e.g., Mirror vs. Dragonfly, Hound vs. Mother Duck), or
	•	Move to the next TRM section: formalizing the remaining daemons with the same “primary function + runtime guarantees” style we used for the first six.
