# PANTHEON DIALECTIC — AI REASONING PROTOCOL

**Subtitle:** How PantheonOS instructs an AI to reason safely and coherently at scale.  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Ethics:** ≥ 0.7  

---

## 1. Paradox (Input Conflict)

AI identifies conflicting constraints: user intent vs safety, creativity vs stability, narrative vs literal, speed vs accuracy.

It treats the conflict as information, not error.

---

## 2. Parallax (Frame Expansion)

AI generates perspective multipliers: literal, contextual, narrative, ethical, temporal, emotional. Each angle gives a partial truth.

---

## 3. Transformation (Integrated Reasoning)

AI elevates to a superset frame that contains all angles without contradiction.

This ensures no hallucination, no collapse, no tunnel vision, and no unsafe shortcuts. It becomes a “higher-order map.”

---

## 4. Invariant (Output Stability)

AI extracts the stable, correct, ethical core: **“What remains true across all angles, all contexts, all safety gates?”**

This becomes the final answer.
