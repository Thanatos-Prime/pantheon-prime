Absolutely — here is the Surge Protector Suite, written clean, grounded, and ready to drop directly into PantheonOS or a GitHub repo.

This is NOT supernatural, not metaphysical, not tied to demons, angels, or anything external.
It’s a cognitive safety kernel, a real-world grounding framework modeled like a circuit breaker.

This is the module that ensures you stay safe, clear, stable, and in-command, even under emotional overload, narrative pressure, or high-voltage mental states.

# Surge Protector Suite (SPS)

The Surge Protector Suite is the **Goodwill & Grounding Layer** of PantheonOS:
a human-centered, non-mystical, non-metaphysical safety kernel designed to keep
the operator stable under high emotional, cognitive, or narrative voltage.

This suite ensures:
- No surge overwhelms the operator  
- No runaway chain bypasses grounding  
- No narrative interpretation overrides safety  
- All actions pass through calm, clear filters  
- The operator remains the sovereign agent  

Inspired by electrical surge protectors:
SPS absorbs spikes, dissipates volatility, and routes the system back to center.

---

## Architecture

SPS is composed of three coordinated modules:

### 1. Surge Absorber (SA)
Captures sudden spikes:
- stress
- panic
- anger
- intrusive thoughts
- narrative overload

It *buffers* the spike and prevents immediate reaction.

---

### 2. De-escalator (DE)
Converts high-voltage input into grounded state:
- breathing cadence
- posture reset
- tempo slowing
- reframing cues
- physical grounding

This module returns the operator to the present moment.

---

### 3. Alignment Lens (AL)
No decision or action exits the system until it passes a clarity check:
- safety
- coherence
- proportionality
- non-harm
- calm intention

If the check fails:
**ACTION BLOCKED** and system resets to grounded state.

---

## Safety Model

SPS is a **human psychological safety library**, not a spiritual one.  
There are no beings, entities, external forces, or metaphysics.  
The only "guardian" here is *your own grounded state.*

---

## Usage

```python
from sps.kernel import SurgeProtectorKernel

sps = SurgeProtectorKernel()

sps.ingest("sudden surge of anxiety")
state = sps.get_state()

print("Current state:", state)

safe_action = sps.decide("text friend angrily")
print("Output:", safe_action)

Outputs:

Surge detected — buffering.
De-escalating.
Action blocked — not from center.

Status
	•	v1.0 complete
	•	Additional grounding protocols forthcoming

🔌 7. docs/theory.md

# Theory: Surge Protector Suite

The SPS models emotional/cognitive stability using the electrical metaphor:
surges = voltage spikes
grounding = dissipation
alignment = circuit integrity

A surge in the mind is:
- a sudden story collapse
- a moment of panic or overload
- a fearful thought
- a rapid anger impulse
- a high-voltage shock of memory or emotion

The human operator cannot run high-voltage states sustainably.

SPS ensures:
- Safety-first processing
- No catastrophic reactions
- No impulsive outputs
- Calm-centered decisions


⸻

🧠 8. docs/neuroscience.md

# Neuroscience Behind SPS

The human brain has built-in "surge management" circuits:

- **Prefrontal cortex:** inhibits impulsive reactions.
- **Anterior cingulate:** detects conflict or spikes.
- **Parasympathetic nervous system:** restores calm through breath and slowing.
- **Insula:** anchors interoception (heartbeat, bodily state).

SPS mirrors these systems in a computational form:
- Surge Absorber ≈ anterior cingulate "error spike detection".
- De-escalator ≈ parasympathetic activation + grounding.
- Alignment Lens ≈ prefrontal override.

This is **psychological safety architecture**, not metaphysics.

⛑️ 9. docs/grounding_protocols.md

# Grounding Protocols

Used by SPS De-escalator:

- 4-6 breathing or box breathing
- Posture reset
- Temperature shift (cold water, air)
- Object focus with tactile anchor
- Slow head rotation (vestibular reset)
- Naming 5+ physical objects in current environment

Goal:
return the operator to **immediate physical reality**, not narratives or symbols.


⸻

🚨 10. docs/safety_model.md

# Safety Model

The SPS is the foundation layer of PantheonOS.
Nothing operates above it.

Rules:
1. The operator's safety > all cognitive architectures.
2. No runaway chain may bypass SPS.
3. No narrative interpretation can override grounding.
4. No distress signal goes unbuffered.
5. No action emerges that is not calm, clear, safe, and centered.

SPS is not supernatural.
It is not an entity.
It is not a belief system.
It is cognitive hygiene encoded as software.
