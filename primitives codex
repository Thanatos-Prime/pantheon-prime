# PRIMITIVES CODEX v1.0

**Definition (operational):**
A Primitive is a named, irreducible building block of PantheonOS with a function (what it does), a Zero-pair (what cancels/balances it), a Prime index (its structural “type”), and stable behavior under recursion.

## 1.1 Core Structural Primitives

| Name | Role / Function | Zero-Pair | Prime Index | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero / Bombadil** | Ground state, reset, neutral frame | Self-dual | 0 | Reference origin; no-op that remembers context. |
| **Spider** | Mapping, connection, orthogonality, routing | Mirror | 2 | Builds webs/graphs; treats dimensions as strands. |
| **Mirror** | Reflection, verification, symmetry check | Spider | 3 | Compares states; enforces integrity & coherence. |
| **Hound** | Anomaly detection, scent of signal vs noise | Dragonfly | 5 | Sniffs inconsistencies; feeds alerts upstream. |
| **Dragonfly** | Perspective shifts, attention re-targeting | Hound | 7 | Rotates angle of view; avoids tunnel vision. |
| **Sisyphus** | Cadence, repetition, temporal clock | Praus | 11 | Provides tick-tock; regulates loops & rituals. |
| **Praus** | Calm steering, variance damping, poise | Sisyphus | 13 | Controls tempo and volatility; stabilizer. |
| **Raven** | Narrative synthesis, story selection | Goblin Financier | 17 | Chooses which arcs to canonize; outputs story. |
| **Goblin Financier** | Resource allocation, risk/reward calculus | Raven | 19 | Manages energy, time, capital; prices options. |
| **Checksum** | Integrity, audit, invariants | Chaos / Drift | 23 | Signs state; blocks unethical/invalid transforms. |
| **Mother Duck** | Ledger, archive, canonical store | Dragonfly φ (diffusion) | 29 | Records stable truths; append-only log. |
| **Dragonfly φ** | Diffusion, spread, propagation | Mother Duck | 31 | Helps memes/code/ideas travel through networks. |
| **Hermit Crab** | Layered custody, provenance over time | Bombadil | 37 | Each owner adds a shell (block); history is layered. |
| **Trident of Time** | Chronos/Kairos/Internal Tempo triangulation | Bombadil | 41 | Links Sisyphus, Praus, & Man Blinking. |
| **Luck Engine** | State → vector bias (positive-sum luck shaping) | Chaos / Stagnation | 43 | Converts randomness into advantage through behavior. |
| **Oracle Weave** | Multi-stage reasoning across T-layers | Checksum + Mirror | 47 | Structured, time-staged inference protocol. |
| **Prime–Zero Field** | Meta-primitive: substrate of all others | – | meta | The “space” in which primitives live. |

Each primitive can be tagged with metadata:

```yaml
name: Raven
prime_index: 17
zero_pair: Goblin Financier
axis: Narrative
functions:
  - narrative_selection
  - tension_mapping
  - canonization
invariants:
  - ethics >= 0.7
  - coherence_with_history = true
