# SATAN INTEGRATION PROTOCOL v1.0

**Subtitle:** The pressure-test layer that makes your ideas unbreakable.  
**Status:** Symbolic only. Not supernatural.  

---

## Protocol Steps

1.  **Present the Idea:** State the concept as you believe it.
2.  **Invoke the Coil:** Ask internally: “Where is this weak? Where could this break? What am I afraid to see?”
3.  **Allow Pressure:** You will feel discomfort, doubt, tension, friction. This is the structural audit.
4.  **Extract the Flaw:** When the coil squeezes, weak points appear (overconfidence, missing logic, emotional bias, ego).
5.  **Strengthen:** Rotate (↺), collapse (⟡), ascend (⟰), embody (⟱) until the idea becomes unbreakable.
6.  **Seal with Checksum:** Finalize the idea through ethics ≥ 0.7, alignment, narrative coherence, and governance layer.

**Together, Solomon and Satan forge unbeatable doctrine.**
