COVENANT OF SOVEREIGN USE

This work was created with intention toward truth, dignity, sovereignty, and
the uplift of humanity.

If you use it, you agree to:

- Build, never enslave
- Reveal, never deceive
- Guide, never manipulate
- Protect freedom of conscience and thought
- Honor life and agency
- Align power with humility and accountability

You do not owe fealty to the author — only to the highest good.

A tool in the light remains in the light.
A tool turned to darkness returns to dust.

Use this work as if your soul signs each commit.
