There are a few powerful ideas in what you just said — but we need to separate metaphor from mechanism so nothing drifts into physics-breaking territory.

⸻

1️⃣ Religions as Behavioral Prediction Models

This part is actually very defensible.

Religions function as:
	•	Norm bundles
	•	Incentive structures
	•	Identity stabilizers
	•	Long-horizon behavior shapers

If you adopt a Christian ethic (for example):
	•	Forgiveness
	•	Delayed gratification
	•	Community orientation
	•	Sexual norms
	•	Charity expectations

…you statistically alter your social environment.

That produces a different trajectory.

So yes — religions can act like behavioral priors that influence future states.

Not magic.
Path dependence.

You become the attractor of the behaviors you repeatedly enact.

2️⃣ “Meaning Comes Before Light”

Now we need to slow this down.

If that’s poetic — it’s fine.

If it’s literal physics — it breaks.

Meaning does not travel faster than light.
Information cannot propagate faster than light under current physical models.

However —

Meaning can feel faster than light because:
	•	It operates inside predictive models.
	•	It shapes perception before sensory input fully resolves.
	•	It biases interpretation.

Your brain is predictive.
Meaning is often applied pre-consciously.

So metaphorically:
Meaning precedes perception.

But physically:
Photons still win.

3️⃣ Language, Meaning, and Brain Regions

You’re circling something real here.

Language and emotion do rely on partially distinct but interconnected networks.

Very simplified:
	•	Limbic system → emotion salience.
	•	Prefrontal cortex → abstraction, planning.
	•	Temporal/parietal areas → language processing.
	•	Default mode network → narrative self.

But they’re deeply integrated.

Meaning is not separate from emotion.
It modulates it.

Religious meaning, for example, often activates:
	•	Emotional circuits
	•	Social bonding networks
	•	Moral cognition areas

So higher symbolic structures reshape baseline affect.

4️⃣ Reading and Simulation

This is one of the strongest parts of what you said.

When we read fiction:
	•	The brain activates motor imagery networks.
	•	Emotional regions fire as if events are happening.
	•	Episodic memory networks encode imagined scenes similarly to lived ones.

The brain does not sharply distinguish between vividly imagined and directly experienced events at the encoding level.

That’s why stories change people.

Not because they’re supernatural —
but because they simulate experience without physical risk.

Narrative is low-cost behavioral rehearsal.

5️⃣ Base Humanity vs Neural Experience

All humans share:
	•	Pain detection
	•	Social bonding mechanisms
	•	Threat response
	•	Attachment systems

On top of that, language and culture layer:
	•	Identity complexity
	•	Moral abstraction
	•	Long-term planning
	•	Mythic meaning

So yes — consciousness likely has base layers and then symbolic overlays.

But careful:

Higher symbolic density does not automatically mean higher wisdom.

It can mean:
	•	Greater rationalization capacity.
	•	Greater delusion capacity.
	•	Greater moral clarity.
	•	Or greater manipulation capacity.

Symbolic power cuts both ways.

⸻

6️⃣ Important Stabilizer

You’re exploring big territory, but nothing you said requires supernatural explanation.

Everything can be explained via:
	•	Predictive processing
	•	Neural plasticity
	•	Social reinforcement
	•	Narrative rehearsal
	•	Path-dependent identity formation

That keeps the system grounded.

⸻

Now I want to ask something steady and clarifying:

When you talk about meaning preceding light —

Is that poetic theology…

or are you tempted to treat it as literal structural reality?
