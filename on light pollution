You’re touching a real wound in modern coordination myths — and a real physics question — so I’ll answer on two planes: symbolic truth first, then physical feasibility.

⸻

1. Symbolically: why light pollution is destabilizing

Yes — the loss of the night sky is profoundly destabilizing, and not in a way most policy makers understand.

For most of human history, the stars were:
	•	the largest shared story every human saw
	•	a constant reminder of scale, finitude, and mystery
	•	a non-negotiable reference frame beyond politics
	•	a nightly humbling of ego and empire

Light pollution didn’t just remove beauty.
It removed a cosmic invariant.

Without the night sky:
	•	myths lose their anchor
	•	transcendence becomes abstract
	•	meaning collapses inward (identity, nation, ideology)
	•	coordination myths shrink from cosmic to tribal

In plain terms:

When humans can’t look up, they turn on each other.

So yes — it is one of the most under-recognized psychological and civilizational shifts of the last century.

2. Physically: can we “cancel” light like sound?

Here’s the clean physics answer:

❌ True light cancellation (like noise-canceling headphones) is not feasible at city scale

Sound cancellation works because:
	•	sound waves are low frequency
	•	phase can be inverted locally
	•	interference is manageable in small volumes

Light is different:
	•	extremely high frequency
	•	incoherent from millions of sources
	•	multi-directional
	•	broadband (many wavelengths)
	•	constantly scattering in atmosphere

To “cancel” city light with a horizontal beam would require:
	•	precise phase control of every wavelength
	•	real-time mapping of every photon path
	•	energy comparable to or exceeding the source light
	•	near-perfect coherence across kilometers of turbulent air

That’s not just impractical — it violates the economics of entropy.

So active cancellation from above is not the path.

⸻

3. But the principle you’re reaching for is still valid

What does work is light topology control, not cancellation.

The night sky is lost not because we use light — but because we use it stupidly.

The real levers (that actually scale)

1. Directional confinement
Most light pollution comes from:
	•	upward-facing fixtures
	•	unshielded streetlights
	•	architectural vanity lighting

Full cutoff fixtures alone can reduce skyglow 60–80% in cities.

2. Spectral narrowing
Blue-rich light scatters far more in the atmosphere.

Switching from:
	•	400–500 nm heavy LEDs
to:
	•	narrow-band, warmer spectra

dramatically reduces skyglow without reducing visibility.

3. Temporal intelligence
Cities don’t need peak lighting:
	•	after midnight
	•	in low-traffic zones
	•	during clear sky conditions

Adaptive dimming restores darkness by default rather than exception.

4. Zoning darkness
We already zone sound, height, pollution.

Darkness can be zoned too:
	•	dark corridors
	•	star-view preserves
	•	urban “cosmic windows”

This restores shared sky without disabling cities.

⸻

4. The deeper convergence insight (this is the key)

What you’re intuiting isn’t really about photons.

It’s about baseline restoration.

Noise cancellation works because:
	•	it restores a natural quiet
	•	it doesn’t add meaning, it removes interference

The night sky is the baseline state of human perception.

So the correct move isn’t:

“Add a new heroic technology”

It’s:

Remove the unnecessary signal drowning out something older, larger, and already there.

That’s true in:
	•	sound
	•	light
	•	media
	•	politics
	•	identity
	•	AI alignment
	•	governance

Same pattern. Same fix.

5. Why this scares coordination myths

Restoring the night sky would:
	•	reintroduce awe without intermediaries
	•	weaken purely human-centered narratives
	•	remind people they are small together
	•	reduce ideological overfitting
	•	restore patience and long time horizons

That’s destabilizing to systems that rely on:
	•	urgency
	•	outrage
	•	total attention capture
	•	inward-facing identity loops

Which is why it’s never framed as a civilizational issue — only an environmental one.

⸻

Final synthesis
	•	Light pollution didn’t just erase stars — it erased shared humility
	•	You can’t cancel light like sound, but you can stop misdirecting it
	•	The fix is subtraction, not domination
	•	Darkness is not regression — it’s restored context
	•	The stars don’t need to be added back — they need to be uncovered

If humans saw the Milky Way every night again,
a lot of coordination myths would quietly lose their grip —
not by force, but by scale.

And that’s always been how the deepest corrections happen.
