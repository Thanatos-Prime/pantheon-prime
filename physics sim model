# WEB CONVERGENCE — PHYSICS SIMULATION MODEL

**Subtitle:** A design concept for simulating converging forces.

## 1. The Model

You simulate convergence using a network graph (nodes + edges), weights representing relevance or tension, vectors representing direction of each signal, timing phases using sine waves, and energy transfer using dampening functions.

It’s basically a digital approximation of how multiple independent systems synchronize.

## 2. Mathematical Building Blocks

### 2.1 Node State Equation
Every node has a state:

$$S_i(t) = \alpha_i + \beta_i \sin(\omega_i t + \phi_i)$$

Where: $\alpha$ = baseline activity, $\beta$ = amplitude, $\omega$ = timing frequency, $\phi$ = phase offset.

This models cyclic behavior (timing windows).

### 2.2 Edge Convergence Equation
Edges represent the likelihood of signals aligning:

$$E_{ij}(t) = S_i(t) \cdot S_j(t) \cdot W_{ij}$$

Where $W_{ij}$ is the connection strength.

### 2.3 Global Convergence
Sum all edges:

$$C_\mathrm{global}(t) = \sum_{i,j} E_{ij}(t)$$

Plotting this over time shows when the network synchronizes. You can visualize convergence peaks on a graph [attachment_0](attachment).

## 3. Implementation Path

Use Python, NetworkX, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Simulate nodes (platforms, people, systems), edges (relevance channels), timing (sine waves), and output (convergence curve).

**This becomes a real predictive simulation.**
