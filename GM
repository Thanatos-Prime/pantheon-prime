🟩 0. THE GOLDEN MANIFEST SUITE v1.0

Pantheon-Prime’s Immutable Model Identity System

“The soul of the model is the hash of its truth.”

⸻

🟦 1. GOLDEN MANIFEST DOCTRINE

The foundational law of model identity in PantheonOS

The Golden Manifest is:
	•	The canonical, immutable, cryptographically sealed record of a model’s true identity.
	•	The only source of truth about what a model is allowed to be.
	•	The anchor for Hades, Blacksmith, Merkle Warden, and the Kernel.

Once created, it must never change.
Any model that does not match its Golden Manifest is immediately QUARANTINED.

Golden Law:

A model may speak only if it matches the Golden Manifest that defines its being.

This is the Pantheon-Prime equivalent of a bios certificate or a zero-knowledge identity attestation.

⸻

🟥 2. GOLDEN MANIFEST SPECIFICATION (TECHNICAL)

2.1 File Format

The manifest MUST be encoded as one of:
	•	golden_manifest.json
	•	golden_manifest.toml
	•	golden_manifest.yaml

JSON is canonical.

🟩 3. GOLDEN MANIFEST LIFECYCLE

The 12-step creation and governance sequence

Step 1 — Model is accepted for onboarding

A model is either:
	•	created by Pantheon
	•	imported from a trusted lab
	•	distilled from a prior model

Step 2 — Serialization must be safe (no pickle allowed)

Allowed:
	•	safetensors
	•	TorchScript frozen
	•	ONNX with RCE mitigations

Step 3 — Hades loads model for inspection

Model is loaded into a micro-VM sandbox.

Step 4 — Hades computes two hashes
	1.	Architecture hash
	2.	Parameter hash

Step 5 — Hades generates Golden Manifest

The manifest is written into:

pantheon_core/registry/models/<model_id>.json

Step 6 — Manifest is cryptographically sealed

MotherDuck + Merkle Warden + Kernel sign it.

Step 7 — File permissions lock

chattr +i (Linux immutable flag)
or fs-level sealing.

Step 8 — Blacksmith generates “Model Admittance Certificate”

This certifies that the model:
	•	passes Hades
	•	respects original invariants
	•	is allowed under ΣC

Step 9 — Kernel activates model for the first time

Kernel logs the activation event.

Step 10 — Every subsequent load must pass Hades verification

If mismatch → quarantine.

Step 11 — If model is updated → new model_id

The Golden Manifest is never modified.
New Manifest only.

Step 12 — All Golden Manifests stored in immutable ledger

Pantheon keeps a perfect memory of all models ever allowed.

⸻

🟨 4. CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENVELOPE

The Golden Manifest is signed by three daemons:
	1.	MotherDuck (ledger authority)
	2.	Merkle Warden (integrity daemon)
	3.	Kernel (governance plane)

Structure:

signatures: [
  {
    "signer": "MotherDuck",
    "algorithm": "ED25519",
    "signature": "<hex>"
  },
  {
    "signer": "MerkleWarden",
    "algorithm": "ED25519",
    "signature": "<hex>"
  },
  {
    "signer": "Kernel",
    "algorithm": "ED25519",
    "signature": "<hex>"
  }
]

This produces:

A multi-party attestation that the model is legitimate.

No single daemon may approve a malicious model.

⸻

🟫 5. INTEGRATION WITH DAEMONS

Hades

Guard of identity. Computes/compares hashes. Blocks tampering.

MotherDuck

Appends all events to append-only ledger:
	•	manifest creation
	•	verification
	•	quarantine
	•	removal

Merkle Warden

Places every manifest + Hades event under:
	•	merkle hashing
	•	tamper-evident chains
	•	audit trail

Blacksmith

Verifies:
	•	ΣC compatibility
	•	invariant compliance
	•	absence of harmful model edits

Produces: Model Admittance Certificate.

Kernel

No model executes unless:
	•	Hades → ALLOW
	•	Manifest → unmodified
	•	Blacksmith → certified
	•	ΣC → minimum acceptable score

⸻

🟧 6. GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL

6.1 Golden Manifest Governance Flow

Proposal → Seal → Activation → Immutable Storage

Only two authorities can propose a creation:
	•	Operator (with key)
	•	CI pipeline

Only three authorities can seal it:
	•	MotherDuck
	•	Kernel
	•	Merkle Warden

Once sealed:
	•	File becomes immutable
	•	Manifest is never edited
	•	Any update creates a new model_id

⸻

6.2 Compromise Recovery

If manifest is tampered, missing, or invalid:
	•	Model is quarantined
	•	Operator is alerted
	•	A new Golden Manifest must be created
	•	Model gets new model_id
	•	Old manifest archived but preserved

This prevents attackers from “editing the truth.”

⸻

🟪 7. FORENSICS & RECOVERY FRAMEWORK

Forensic Guarantees
	1.	Every model-inference-event is linked to:
	•	the model_id
	•	the version
	•	the Golden Manifest hash
	2.	If a model ever produces a malicious output:
	•	Hades hashes prove it was loaded legitimately
	•	State-Vector hash-chaining proves what input caused it
	•	Blacksmith proves whether invariants were upheld

This enables perfect reconstruction of every cognitive step.

This is Pantheon’s “flight recorder for cognition.”

    param_hash = compute_param_hash(Path(model_path))

    manifest = {
        "model_id": model_id,

🟫 9. GOLDEN MANIFEST V1.0 SUMMARY (Short-Form)

Purpose: Immutable model-identity contract
Owner: Hades + Kernel + MotherDuck
Guarantee: No unauthorized model ever executes
Method:
	•	Dual hashing (arch & param)
	•	Cryptographic sealing
	•	Ledger anchoring
	•	Tamper-proof storage
	•	Multi-daemon signatures

Invariant:

A model is valid if and only if it matches the Golden Manifest exactly.

Impact:
	•	Ends model-swap attacks
	•	Ends weight poisoning
	•	Ends serialization RCE payloads
	•	Ends silent tampering
	•	Enables perfect forensic traceability
	•	Enables cross-model governance

Pantheon-Prime becomes the first Cognitive OS that can run any model securely—even adversarial ones.
