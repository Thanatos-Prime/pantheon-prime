Here’s a clean, practical framework to improve comprehension, grounded in what we’ve been discussing (compression, re-embedding, silence), but usable day-to-day.

⸻

1. Improve comprehension by changing the representation

If you don’t understand something, don’t reread it the same way.

Rotate it:
	•	Text → diagram
	•	Linear → circular
	•	Narrative → bullets
	•	Symbols → examples
	•	Examples → rules

Rule:

If comprehension stalls, the representation is wrong—not you.

⸻

2. Actively search for the shortest explanation

Comprehension increases as effective description length decreases.

Try this loop:
	1.	Explain it in 5 sentences
	2.	Compress to 2 sentences
	3.	Compress to 1 sentence
	4.	Compress to a metaphor
	5.	Compress to a diagram or equation

If you can’t compress it, you don’t yet understand it.

3. Identify the invariant

Ask:
	•	What stays true if I change perspective?
	•	What survives translation?
	•	What breaks when I remove details?

Good comprehension = knowing what does NOT change.

Bad comprehension = memorizing surface features.

⸻

4. Use silence deliberately

Stop filling every gap.

After reading or learning:
	•	Pause for 30–60 seconds
	•	Do nothing
	•	Let the brain auto-compress

This is not woo — it allows subconscious pattern extraction.

Insight often appears after input stops.

⸻

5. Teach it incorrectly on purpose

This is powerful.

Try to:
	•	Explain it badly
	•	Over-simplify it
	•	Use the wrong analogy

Then ask:
	•	What feels wrong?
	•	What breaks?

Those breaks reveal the real structure.

⸻

6. Switch domains

Translate the idea into:
	•	Music
	•	Geometry
	•	Biology
	•	Economics
	•	Social systems

If it doesn’t translate at all, it’s likely:
	•	too vague
	•	too brittle
	•	or poorly understood

Robust ideas survive metaphor.

⸻

7. Ask the one question that matters

Instead of:
	•	“What does this mean?”

Ask:

“What problem does this compress?”

Understanding is recognizing why something exists, not just what it says.

⸻

8. Keep the 2/3 + 1/3 rule
	•	2/3: explicit understanding (definitions, mechanics)
	•	1/3: tacit intuition (felt sense, pattern recognition)

Trying to force 100% explicitness reduces comprehension, not increases it.

⸻

9. Test comprehension with prediction

Real understanding lets you:
	•	Predict what happens next
	•	Predict failure modes
	•	Predict where it breaks

If you can’t predict, you’re still memorizing.

⸻

10. End with reality

Always re-embed:
	•	How does this show up in the real world?
	•	Where would this fail?
	•	What constraint would break it?

Reality is the final exam.

⸻

One-line summary (keep this)

Comprehension improves when you reduce description length, rotate perspective, preserve invariants, and leave space for silence.

You’re already doing this instinctively.
This just gives you handles so you can do it on command.

If you want, next I can:
	•	build a comprehension drill you can reuse
	•	show how to teach others using this method
	•	or map this directly to LLMs / meta-learning

Just say the word.
