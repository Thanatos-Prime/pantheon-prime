Good. This is solid, but it’s still descriptive-academic.
Hammer pass below: what’s missing, underweighted, or insufficiently nailed down for Pantheon-grade recursive governance.

I’ll be precise.

What This Definition Still Misses (Relative to Pantheon)

1. Termination Conditions (Hard Stops, Not Just Damping)

You talk about infinite loops and instability, but you never close the loop with authority.

Most recursive governance literature hand-waves with:
	•	thresholds
	•	damping
	•	pruning

Pantheon needs something sharper:

What’s missing
	•	Explicit halt states
	•	Non-negotiable veto authority
	•	Conditions under which recursion must stop, not just slow

Pantheon-specific fix
Add a principle like:

Termination Invariant: Any recursive loop must have a provable halt condition enforced by an independent integrity function.

This is where Mirror + Checksum matter.
Most frameworks assume “good faith recursion.” Pantheon assumes failure and adversarial pressure.

⸻

2. Asymmetry of Power Inside Recursion

Your description treats recursion as symmetric: everything can evaluate everything.

That’s dangerous.

What’s missing
	•	Clear asymmetric roles inside the recursive loop
	•	Distinction between:
	•	who can observe
	•	who can recommend
	•	who can block
	•	who can execute

Without this, recursive systems collapse into:
	•	consensus sludge, or
	•	runaway self-legitimation

Pantheon edge
Pantheon already encodes asymmetric power:
	•	Hound can flag, not decide
	•	Mirror can veto, not generate
	•	Mother Duck can record, not interpret

Action
Name this explicitly:

Role-Asymmetry Rule: Recursive governance requires unequal permissions across observation, judgment, execution, and memory.

Almost no academic framework states this cleanly.

⸻

3. Time Is Treated Too Softly

You reference iteration, cycles, and feedback — but time is implicit, not governed.

This is a critical miss.

What’s missing
	•	Time-bounded authority
	•	Decay of decisions
	•	Temporal priority rules (“newer ≠ stronger”)

Pantheon difference
Pantheon treats time as a constraint:
	•	Decisions age
	•	Authority expires
	•	Memory persists but influence decays

Add this

Temporal Governance Invariant: All governance actions have a defined lifespan, decay curve, and renewal condition.

This prevents:
	•	frozen bad decisions
	•	recursive tyranny
	•	institutional calcification

Most governance systems fail here.

⸻

4. No Explicit Separation Between Truth, Policy, and Narrative

You mention narrative, but you never separate layers.

That’s fatal in practice.

What’s missing
	•	A three-layer distinction:
	1.	Truth claims (what is)
	2.	Policy constraints (what must be)
	3.	Narrative frames (how it’s explained)

Recursive systems that mix these get captured by story.

Pantheon strength
Pantheon:
	•	allows narrative
	•	audits it
	•	never lets it mutate truth or policy silently

You should lock this

Layer Separation Rule: Recursive governance must maintain strict boundaries between truth evaluation, policy enforcement, and narrative framing.

This is rare and powerful.

⸻

5. Graceful Decay Is Mentioned, Not Operationalized

You gesture at abandonment and decay — but you don’t define how it behaves.

What’s missing
	•	What degrades first?
	•	What is preserved longest?
	•	What never degrades?

Pantheon answer
	•	Capability decays
	•	Memory persists
	•	Invariants remain

State it bluntly

Abandonment Protocol: In the absence of operators, capability reduces before invariants weaken, and memory outlives execution authority.

This is Garcia-Clause-grade thinking. Most frameworks dodge it.

⸻

6. No Adversarial Model

Everything you wrote assumes:
	•	cooperative actors
	•	good-faith evolution
	•	honest feedback

That’s not the world.

What’s missing
	•	Explicit adversarial pressure
	•	Governance capture attempts
	•	Recursive spoofing (systems gaming their own metrics)

Pantheon already assumes this
That’s why Hound exists.

Add

Adversarial Assumption: Recursive governance must assume actors may attempt to game, capture, or exploit the recursive process itself.

Without this, recursion becomes theater.

⸻

What You Got Right (Keep These)
	•	Fractal / multi-scale framing ✔
	•	Failure as retained structure ✔
	•	Modular, auditable components ✔
	•	Reversibility without erasure ✔
	•	Emergent scaling via local interaction ✔

These align well with Pantheon and should stay.

Hammer Summary (What to Add in 6 Lines)

If you compress this for the Pantheon brief, the missing pillars are:
	1.	Termination invariants (hard stops)
	2.	Role asymmetry inside recursion
	3.	Explicit time governance
	4.	Truth / policy / narrative separation
	5.	Operational abandonment behavior
	6.	Adversarial assumptions baked in

Add those, and your definition stops being academic recursive governance
and becomes operational recursive governance under fire.

If you want, next move:
	•	I can rewrite this entire section in Pantheon voice (≤300 words), or
	•	Extract a formal invariant list suitable for a spec or README.

Hammer ready.
