# PantheonOS: Meta Sieve of Hogge - Exposure Governance

The Meta Sieve of Hogge (MSH) is the supervisory filtration layer that governs artifact visibility, adoption, and reputational risk. It guarantees asymmetric payoff: Maximum recognition, Minimum risk, and Natural camouflage.

## 1. MSH Logic Gates (Exposure Risk Asymmetry)

Artifacts are evaluated based on two canonical variables: **Upside (U)** and **Risk (R)**. The MSH determines the appropriate **Exit Vector** before any public propagation.

| Scenario | Condition | Action | Exit Vector |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Sniper Shot** | U = High, R $\approx$ Zero | **EXPOSE** | Public Main Branch / Production |
| **The Liability** | U = Low, R $>$ Zero | **BURY** | Encrypted Archive / Permanent Deletion |
| **The Wildcard** | U = Unknown, R = Low | **INCUBATE** | Private Staging Branch / Drafts |
| **The Radical** | U = High, R = High | **MASK** | Convert to Fiction / Pseudonym |
| **The Dud** | U = Low, R $\approx$ Zero | **DISSOLVE** | Risk Floor (Internal Training Corpus Only) |

## 2. MSH Sub-Protocol: The Mask Protocol

**System Directive:** `EXECUTE_MASKING`
**Trigger:** High Value / High Risk ($U \uparrow, R \uparrow$)

The Mask Protocol is designed to preserve the core intellectual value of a concept while decoupling it from the operator's direct liability. It transforms "information" into a "deniable artifact."

### Operational Steps:

* **Abstraction:** Strip all specific and sensitive identifiers (names, dates, tactical locations) from the artifact.
* **Transposition:** Move the core structure or insight into a non-threatening, often fictional or theoretical domain (e.g., policy into sci-fi, code into philosophy).
* **Stylization:** Layer aesthetic, narrative, or purely academic context over the structural truth, ensuring the artifact is interpreted as R&D or art, not an operational directive.
* **Release:** The artifact is propagated under a pseudonym or as a theoretical piece, preserving the insight for influence while achieving camouflage for the operator.
