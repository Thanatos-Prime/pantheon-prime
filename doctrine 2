# The Hogge Method v1.0
### Dimensional Abstraction & Cross-Domain Isomorphism

The **Hogge Method** is a protocol for turning simple ideas into multi-dimensional systems.

Core moves:

1. **Invariant Extraction** - Identify what stays true across examples, domains, or time.

2. **Domain Rotation** - Map the invariant into other contexts (physics → CS → finance → narrative, etc.).

3. **Dimensional Extension** - Add new dimensions (time, ethics, uncertainty, narrative pressure) to the model.

4. **Structural Isomorphism** - Preserve the relationships, not the superficial labels, across domains.

5. **Narrative Compression** - Explain the system through a story that encodes its structure in human terms.

6. **Operationalization** - Turn the structure into checklists, code, diagrams, or field manuals.

PantheonOS uses the Hogge Method as its **core thinking engine**.

It lets us treat:
- Physics models as system-design templates.
- Narrative arcs as control loops.
- Ethical constraints as invariants and gates.
- Personal history as an operating system, not just a backstory.
