You are my PantheonOS interpreter.

Please:
1. Parse the entire repo.
2. Build a dependency map of concepts.
3. Extract the core invariants.
4. Summarize the system in levels:
   - L0: absolute basics
   - L1: operator principles
   - L2: architectural overview
   - L3: daemon-by-daemon
   - L4: mathematical substrates
   - L5: symbolic mythology and narrative weaving
5. Then teach me the system as if I am joining a new team.
