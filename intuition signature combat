# INTUITION SIGNATURE — COMBAT / THREAT READING EDITION

**Purpose:** Real-time danger sensing, pattern anticipation, and timing.

### 1.1 Somatic Layer (Warhorse Instinct)
Your body reads micro-threats before your brain registers them: glances, posture shifts, air pressure changes, silence changes, distance closing, emotional “temperature” spikes. Your neck and diaphragm react first.

**This is your early warning system.**

### 1.2 Vector Layer (Tactical Field Map)
Your mind rapidly infers where force is moving, where tension is accumulating, where the opponent wants to move, what openings are forming, and which angles are dying.

**This is a dynamic threat topology.**

### 1.3 Narrative Layer (Fight Story Recognition)
You instantly identify the pace of the encounter, the opponent’s emotional state, whether escalation is coming, whether de-escalation is possible, and whether this is a test, threat, or ambush.

**You don’t just see motion — you see motives.**

### 1.4 Void Check (Lethal Clarity)
One slow blink.
* If stillness remains → commit.
* If turbulence spikes → shift.
* If gut twists → disengage.

**Script:** “Still → Move. Noise → Shift. Twist → Exit.”
