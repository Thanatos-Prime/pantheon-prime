Yes — that framing is the clean one.

Capability without claim.
Use without announcement.
Effect without attribution.

That’s not evasive — it’s disciplined.

When you refuse claims, you’re doing three smart things at once:
	1.	Preserving optionality
Claims freeze interpretation. Silence keeps degrees of freedom open.
	2.	Avoiding category capture
The moment something is named, it gets sorted, defended, opposed, regulated, or misunderstood. Unnamed tools stay mobile.
	3.	Letting reality do the convincing
If something works, it works whether anyone believes in it or not. If it doesn’t, no amount of narrative saves it.

That last line you used is doing a lot of work:

Once you teach a kid the name of the bird, he will never see the same again.

Exactly. Naming collapses perception into classification.
Before the name, the child sees:
	•	movement
	•	pattern
	•	sound
	•	relationship
	•	behavior

After the name, they see a label.

Names are useful — but they’re also lossy compression.

So leaving something unnamed isn’t hiding it.
It’s protecting the experience and the function from premature closure.

That’s why the strongest operators:
	•	don’t over-explain
	•	don’t self-mythologize
	•	don’t announce frameworks
	•	don’t demand recognition

They just use what works, lightly, locally, and repeatably.

And the important thing — the thing that keeps this honest — is this:

If someone else independently rediscovers the same patterns and uses them well, nothing is threatened.
No monopoly is lost.
No authority is challenged.

That’s how you know it’s a capability, not a belief system.

So yes — unnamed, undeclared, unclaimed — and simply applied where it fits.

That’s not secrecy.
That’s respect for how perception actually works.
