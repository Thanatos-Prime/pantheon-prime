I need to ground this safely and precisely, because there’s a real physiological phenomenon here and a real risk if it’s misunderstood.

First — a safety boundary (important)

You should not look directly at the sun. Prolonged or intentional staring can cause permanent retinal damage.
What I’m about to explain is about afterimages and contrast processing, not a practice to perform.

⸻

What you’re describing does work as a claim — physiologically, not mystically

1. The “indigo eye” is a real visual phenomenon

When the visual system is exposed to a very bright stimulus, the retina adapts. When that stimulus is removed, you perceive a negative afterimage:
	•	Bright yellow/white → dark blue / indigo
	•	Circular light source → circular dark “eye”
	•	High intensity → high-contrast inversion

This happens because:
	•	photoreceptors temporarily fatigue
	•	opponent color channels rebound
	•	the brain fills the gap with complementary color

So yes:
the sun produces an indigo negative in the visual field.

That part is not symbolic — it’s optics + neurology.

⸻

2. The “mind’s eye” localization is also real

When you visualize an afterimage or any strong visual impression after closing your eyes, you’re no longer using the retina.

You’re engaging:
	•	the visual cortex
	•	imagery networks
	•	spatial attention systems

People consistently report this visualization as occurring:
	•	behind the forehead
	•	slightly above and between the eyes
	•	in a stable internal “space”

That “space” is not imaginary in the casual sense — it’s a functional workspace the brain uses for internal simulation.

⸻

3. Where the leap must stop (this matters)

Calling that space “the ego” or “the Indigo I” is where interpretation begins, not observation.

What can be said cleanly:
	•	The brain has a centralized representational workspace
	•	Visual imagery, attention, and self-referential thought often co-localize there
	•	Strong contrast stimuli make that workspace more noticeable
	•	The afterimage acts like a pointer, revealing the workspace by absence

What cannot be claimed without crossing into false certainty:
	•	that this is a literal self
	•	that it’s a unique center of consciousness
	•	that it’s a fixed “location of the soul”

It’s a functional hub, not an essence.

⸻

The accurate framing (this keeps it sane)

Here’s the version that holds up:

Extreme contrast reveals the brain’s internal simulation space.
The afterimage is a marker of perceptual processing, not proof of identity.

The “I” isn’t located there.
That space is simply where models appear.

The ego isn’t a thing you find — it’s a process that uses that space.

⸻

Why this still fits your larger pattern (without danger)

You’ve been consistent about:
	•	gradients, not absolutes
	•	lenses, not crowns
	•	perception before identity
	•	restraint over mystification

So the clean synthesis is:
	•	The sun → saturates perception
	•	The afterimage → reveals processing limits
	•	The indigo field → marks the simulation workspace
	•	Awareness → notices that noticing happens

That’s metacognition, not revelation.

⸻

One-line grounding invariant (worth keeping)

Afterimages reveal the limits of perception, not the center of the self.
The ‘I’ isn’t found — it’s inferred.

If you want, we can:
	•	map this to predictive processing / global workspace theory
	•	explain why cultures independently mapped “inner eye” metaphors
	•	or translate this safely into symbolic language for the Money Bin without encouraging harmful practices

But I won’t endorse sun-gazing or claims that imply a literal ego-location.
Keeping this physically safe and epistemically honest is the real discipline here.
