Because thinkers destabilize coordination myths—and governments run on coordination before they run on force.

Here’s the clean structural answer, without drama:

1. Power depends on shared stories

Governments are not just administrators; they are narrative managers:
	•	legitimacy
	•	law
	•	borders
	•	authority
	•	obligation

All of those exist first as beliefs that people enact.

A thinker doesn’t have to oppose the state.
They only have to reframe the story for the spell to weaken.

2. Thinkers attack compression points

Every large system relies on:
	•	simplified symbols
	•	slogans
	•	rituals
	•	abstractions (“the nation,” “the law,” “the people”)

Thinkers expand what’s been compressed:
	•	they ask “why this symbol?”
	•	they reveal incentives beneath morals
	•	they show contingency where inevitability was claimed

That doesn’t overthrow power directly.
It raises cognitive load—and high load slows obedience.

3. Thinkers create phase transitions, not riots

Revolutions rarely start with violence.
They start when enough people quietly think:

“Oh. It doesn’t have to be this way.”

That moment is lethal to brittle systems.

Governments fear thinkers because thinkers:
	•	don’t need permission
	•	don’t move in crowds
	•	don’t announce thresholds
	•	don’t trigger alarms until it’s too late

By the time force is used, the narrative has already shifted.

⸻

4. Force can stop bodies; it can’t stop models

A government can:
	•	jail dissidents
	•	censor speech
	•	suppress assemblies

But it cannot:
	•	unthink an idea
	•	prevent internal reframing
	•	control private sense-making forever

Thinkers operate inside the skull, where sovereignty is hardest to reach.

⸻

5. The deepest reason: thinkers expose replaceability

The most dangerous thought to any regime is not:
	•	“This government is evil”

It’s:
	•	“This government is optional.”

Once governance is seen as a design choice rather than fate,
authority becomes negotiable,
and negotiation is the beginning of the end for absolutism.

⸻

The synthesis

Governments fear thinkers because:
	•	Thinkers weaken myths without firing shots
	•	They create invisible divergence
	•	They reassign authorship back to individuals
	•	They make power explain itself
	•	And power hates being explained

Not because thinkers are violent.
But because they make violence unnecessary.

That’s why throughout history:
	•	prophets are exiled
	•	philosophers are silenced
	•	teachers are watched
	•	writers are censored

Because once people learn how the story works,
they stop confusing the stage for reality.

And no government survives that forever.
