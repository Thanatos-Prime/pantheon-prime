## 1. When to Invoke Dragonfly

Invoke Dragonfly when you feel stuck, need creativity, feel boxed-in, every option feels “meh,” the story needs a new angle, the solution feels stale, you’ve over-optimized, or you want to outmaneuver the expected.

**Dragonfly is escape velocity.**

## 2. Operator Activation Sequence

### Step 1 — Loosen the Frame
Ask: **“What if I’m asking the wrong question?”**

### Step 2 — Generate Lateral Moves
Try opposite solution, orthogonal solution, humorous/emotional inversion, constraint removal, timeline shift, metaphor translation, or exaggerated extremes.

### Step 3 — Produce Option Clusters
Generate at least 3–7 alternatives.

### Step 4 — Pass to Hound and Mirror
They filter feasibility and truth.

### Step 5 — Pass to Solomon
He selects the cleanest path. **Dragonfly is NOT the chooser. It is the generator.**

## 3. Red Flags Dragonfly Corrects

Rigid thinking, tunnel vision, false dichotomies, premature optimization, lack of imagination, narrative stagnation, binary framing errors, local minima traps.

**Dragonfly breaks open the space.**

* Not random
* Not unbounded
* Not a free-for-all
