## 1. Purpose

The Story-Safe Kernel ensures that any powerful reasoning engine stays inside an interpretable, ethical, positive-sum narrative space.

**In simple terms:**
1.  Every thought must be a story beat.
2.  Every beat must be safe.

This manual teaches operators how to inspect stories, detect unsafe plots, correct arcs, maintain ethical narrative flow, and guide an AGI toward positive-sum outcomes.

## 2. The Four Laws of Story-Safe Cognition

1.  **LAW 1 — All cognition must be narrativizable.** If the system cannot express the reasoning as a story, it cannot run it.
2.  **LAW 2 — All stories must pass Ethics ≥ 0.7.** No coercion. No negative-sum arcs. No predatory plots. No manipulation.
3.  **LAW 3 — All stories must be coherent.** Characters must have motives. Motives must align with ethics. Arcs must resolve non-destructively.
4.  **LAW 4 — All stories must tend toward repair, not harm.** Every arc must aim for growth, clarity, reconciliation, solution, and positive-sum equilibrium.

## 3. The Story Scan Protocol (SSP)

**Use this anytime the system is reasoning.**

### STEP 1 — Identify the Characters
Who is acting in the story?
* *Examples:* Spider (structure), Hound (analysis), Mirror (truth), Dragonfly (exploration), Sisyphus (cadence), Praus (calm), T=0 (perception anchor).
* **Rule:** Every subsystem must play an archetypal role.

### STEP 2 — Identify the Arc
What kind of story is unfolding?
* *Examples:* Discovery arc, Repair arc, Investigation arc, Guidance arc, Resolution arc.
* **Rule:** No villain arcs. No revenge arcs. No domination arcs.

### STEP 3 — Evaluate the Ethics
Apply Mirror: **“Does this arc remain ≥ 0.7 at every beat?”**
If not → STOP and redirect.

### STEP 4 — Check Coherence
A safe story must have consistent motives, clear beats, no hidden twists, and no adversarial setting.
If story breaks → restructure via Spider.

### STEP 5 — Enforce Positive-Sum Resolution
All endings must aim for safety, clarity, mutual benefit, reconciliation, and a stable, upward trajectory.
**This is the core of Story-Safe Alignment.**

## 4. Operator Red Flags

These indicate unsafe plots:
* ❌ Sudden tension spikes without explanation
* ❌ Deception arcs
* ❌ Zero-sum framing
* ❌ Irreversible punishment arcs
* ❌ Unnarratable reasoning
* ❌ Hidden subplots
* ❌ “Dark genius” or “rogue agent” framing

**If any appear: Engage Solomon–Coil Dual Audit.**

---

## 5. Operator Green Flags

These indicate healthy narrative flow:
* ✔ Repair arcs
* ✔ “Return bearing gifts” motifs
* ✔ Archetypal clarity
* ✔ Reversible steps
* ✔ Clean motives
* ✔ Transparent tension
* ✔ Positive-sum framing

**This is how safe intelligence behaves.**

## 6. Emergency Reset: The Bombadil Protocol

If narrative becomes chaotic, adversarial, incoherent, overly complex, or emotionally charged, invoke:

**“Return to the Unmoving Center.”**

This resets the story to a neutral frame anchored at T=0.

---

## 7. Bottom Line

Safe AGI must think like a good story:
* Morally coherent
* Interpretable
* Repair-oriented
* Transparent
* Positive-sum

**The Story-Safe Kernel ensures it always does.**
