# Golden Dragon Theorem – Specification v1.0

**Cosmos:** PantheonOS – Golden Dragon Axiom System  
**Document ID:** GD-THEOREM-v1.0  
**Status:** Conceptual / Exploratory (Symbolic Mathematics)

This document describes the *Golden Dragon Theorem* in a clear,
self-contained format suitable for both humans and AI models to use as
a reference when exploring or implementing the associated code.

## 1. The Golden Dragon Axiom Sketch

This is not a rigorous set-theoretic foundation. It is a **mythic
axiom system** designed to structure a symbolic universe.

We define:

### 1.1 Golden Seed (O)

There exists a distinguished origin point:

- `O` is the “Golden Seed”.
- Intuitively: the living zero, the heart of the dragon.

In the toy implementation, we can represent `O = 0.0` on the real line.

---

### 1.2 Heartbeat Map (Φ)

There exists a map:

> Φ: ℝ → ℝ

called the **heartbeat map** of the Golden Dragon.

Interpretation:

- Each application of Φ is one “breath beat” of the cosmos.
- The orbit `{ Φⁿ(x) : n ∈ ℤ }` is the **soul thread** of x.

In the toy implementation, Φ can be implemented as a golden-ratio-like
rotation on a circle:

- Fix a modulus `1.0` (unit circle).
- Define an irrational rotation step, e.g.:

  \[
  Φ(x) = (x + α) \bmod 1
  \]

  where `α` is related to the golden ratio:

  \[
  φ = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad α = φ - 1 \approx 0.618...
  \]

This yields dense orbits on the unit circle for almost all starting
points `x`.

### 1.3 Prime Chakras

Let `P = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...}` denote the primes.

We assign to each prime `p ∈ P` a **chakra phase** on the unit circle:

- Map each prime `p` to an angle `θ_p` in `[0, 1)` (interpreted as
  fractions of a full turn).
- For the toy model, we can define:

  \[
  θ_p = (p * β) \bmod 1
  \]

  for some fixed irrational `β` (e.g. `β = √2 - 1`), or simply

  \[
  θ_p = (p / M) \bmod 1
  \]

  for some large `M` to distribute primes around the circle.

These `θ_p` are the **prime chakras**: special phase points representing
prime “vertebrae” along the dragon’s spine.

---

### 1.4 Soul Threads

For any starting phase `x ∈ [0,1)`, define its **soul thread** as the
orbit under repeated application of the heartbeat map:

\[
O(x) = \{ Φⁿ(x) \mid n ∈ ℤ_{\ge 0} \}
\]

In the numeric toy model, we approximate this by iterating `n` up to
some finite bound `N` and storing `{x, Φ(x), Φ²(x), ..., Φᴺ(x)}`.

## 2. The Golden Dragon Theorem (Conceptual)

> **Theorem (Golden Dragon Theorem I – Infinite Prime Kisses).**  
> In the Golden Dragon cosmos, every soul thread orbit approaches
> prime chakras infinitely often. Intuitively: **no soul thread is
> permanently exiled from prime fire.**

In fully rigorous mathematics, this is not a proven theorem here.
Instead, we treat it as:

- A **guiding narrative principle**: every orbit in a dense,
  irrational-rotation system sweeps through phase space and repeatedly
  visits neighborhoods of special points (prime chakras).
- A **simulation goal**: in numeric experiments, each soul thread hits
  neighborhoods near prime chakras infinitely often (or at least many
  times within a finite cutoff).

---

## 3. Simulation-Level Statement

The code in this repository implements a **simulation-level version**
of the theorem:

> For a chosen heartbeat map Φ and a finite set of prime chakras
> `{θ_p}`, and for any initial phase `x`, the finite orbit
> `{Φⁿ(x) : 0 ≤ n ≤ N}` will pass near multiple prime chakras
> many times as `N` grows.

We say that an orbit point `y` is **“near a prime chakra p”** if:

\[
\min(|y - θ_p|, 1 - |y - θ_p|) < ε
\]

for a small threshold `ε > 0`.

The example script records which primes are approached and how often,
demonstrating the “flavor” of the theorem.

---

## 4. Implementation Summary

- Heartbeat map `Φ(x)` is implemented as an irrational rotation on the
  unit circle (mod 1).
- Prime chakras are implemented as positions on the same circle.
- A soul thread is generated by iterating `Φ` and storing orbit points.
- A proximity function checks when an orbit point lies near a chakra.
- The output shows that for typical `x`, the orbit passes arbitrarily
  close to multiple prime chakras, many times, within a finite sample.

---

## 5. Philosophical Note

This system is a **symbolic cosmology**, not a replacement for
standard analysis or number theory. It is intended as:

- an artistic representation of number-theoretic intuition;
- a playground for exploring connections between:
  - dense orbits,
  - irrational rotations,
  - primes as special “resonance points”,
  - and narrative descriptions of infinity.

Use this document as a conceptual scaffold paired with the
implementation in `src/golden_dragon`.
