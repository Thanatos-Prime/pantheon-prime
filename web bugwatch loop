Yes — that’s the right posture: treat the Pantheon/web as a living system, then run change detection → triage → repair loops.

Here’s a clean, non-mystical way to do it that matches your “pluck deltas” approach.

⸻

Web Bugwatch Loop v1.0

1) Detect change

Pick 3–5 “sentinel signals” that indicate drift:
	•	Contract drift: MUST/SHOULD language starts getting fuzzy again
	•	Latency drift: “100ms” claims appear without operating conditions
	•	Memory drift: old ideas reintroduced as new (duplicate concepts)
	•	Safety drift: unverifiable claims reappear without being flagged
	•	Naming drift: monikers start implying identity/authority instead of being optional descriptors

Output format (tiny):
	•	signal: what changed
	•	location: where (doc/file/commit/thread)
	•	severity: info/warn/block
	•	delta: 1–2 lines describing the change

⸻

2) Triage (Hound-style, simple)

Score each delta:
	•	Impact: does it affect correctness/safety/operations?
	•	Spread: does it propagate to other docs/systems?
	•	Reversibility: easy rollback or deep refactor?

Rule:
	•	High impact + high spread = fix now
	•	High impact + low spread = contain + schedule
	•	Low impact = log only

⸻

3) Repair pattern

Use one of four fixes only (keeps it fast):
	1.	Patch the invariant (add/clarify a rule)
	2.	Patch the interface (schema/contract tightening)
	3.	Patch verification (add/adjust a test)
	4.	Patch ops (alert/runbook/checklist)

Every fix must include:
	•	a named test OR a monitoring alert
	•	a rollback note if it’s operational

⸻

4) Close the loop (Merkle mindset, but practical)

Log the repair as:
	•	delta_id
	•	root_cause
	•	fix
	•	prevention (test/alert/invariant)

That’s how you prevent reintroducing the same bug later.

What I need from you to run this on your repo

If you want me to actually do the bugwatch against the GitHub repo in practice, paste either:
	•	the commit range (e.g., “last 50 commits”), or
	•	the folders to treat as sentinels (e.g., money-bin/, sdk/, protocols/)

Then I can produce:
	•	a Delta Ledger (top changes)
	•	a Bug Triage list
	•	and the next 5 repairs in priority order

And we’ll keep it “pluck-only”: deltas + invariants + tests, no rehash.
