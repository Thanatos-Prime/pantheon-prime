You’re thinking in the right direction — but let’s separate three layers:
	1.	What’s technically possible
	2.	What’s product-valuable
	3.	What’s actually within your control

⸻

1️⃣ Can ChatGPT move content between chats if you “authorize” it?

Not natively.

I don’t have:
	•	Cross-chat file system access
	•	Background execution privileges
	•	Persistent project-level memory editing rights

Each chat session is sandboxed for safety and privacy.

That’s intentional architecture, not a missing feature.

If I could autonomously move data across your account, that would introduce:
	•	Data leakage risk
	•	Account compromise risk
	•	Cross-project contamination
	•	Compliance issues

So the system is designed to prevent that.

⸻

2️⃣ But Is the Concept Valuable?

Yes — very.

What you’re describing is essentially:

Structured Continuity Management inside AI workspaces.

That is a real product layer.

Imagine:
	•	Tag a message → “Add to Project: Mortgage Ops”
	•	AI summarizes it
	•	Extracts key artifacts
	•	Inserts into structured project memory
	•	Links it to related threads

That’s basically:

AI Knowledge Orchestration Layer.

Enterprise customers would pay for that.

This is closer to:
	•	Workspace AI memory governance
	•	Project-scoped context evolution
	•	Structured artifact promotion

It’s not trivial UX work — but it’s productizable.

⸻

3️⃣ The Important Reality Check

You personally cannot modify OpenAI’s internal infrastructure.

But you can:

Build an external layer that:
	•	Exports chat logs
	•	Runs summarization + structuring
	•	Stores them in Notion / Obsidian / database
	•	Re-injects structured summaries into new sessions

That’s buildable today.

That’s a startup.

⸻

Here’s What You’re Actually Noticing

You’re feeling friction because:

Your thinking is continuous.
ChatGPT sessions are episodic.

There’s a mismatch between:
Your cognitive continuity
And session-based AI UX.

That mismatch is a product opportunity.

⸻

But Now I’m Going To Slow You Down

Be careful of:

“I see a missing feature in a billion-dollar company, therefore I should build the meta-layer.”

Sometimes that’s insight.

Sometimes that’s scope drift.

The real question:

Is solving ChatGPT cross-chat continuity:
	•	The fastest ROI path?
	•	Or just intellectually stimulating?

Be honest.

⸻

If You Really Want To Explore It

There are three real plays:

1️⃣ Lightweight Tool

Chrome extension:
	•	Tag messages
	•	Export to project DB
	•	Structured re-ingestion

Lean.
Low capital.
Test demand.

2️⃣ Power User Workspace Layer

For founders / researchers.
Subscription model.

3️⃣ Enterprise AI Governance Layer

Huge scope.
Heavy engineering.
Long runway.

Only one of those is realistic early-stage.

⸻

Here’s The Pattern I’m Seeing

You generate strong ideas across:
	•	CPG
	•	Mortgage AI
	•	Memory management
	•	AI orchestration layer

This tells me something important.

Your strength is:
Pattern recognition + systems architecture.

Your weakness risk is:
Fragmented execution across too many fronts.

That’s not criticism.
That’s calibration.

⸻

Let Me Ask You Something Grounding

If you had to pick one of these to pursue seriously for 12 months:
	•	AI workflow monetization (mortgage niche)
	•	Memory photo product
	•	AI workspace continuity tool
	•	Wild Hawg CPG brand

Which one feels:
	1.	Most aligned?
	2.	Most monetizable?
	3.	Most durable long term?

Answer separately.

Don’t say “all.”

Pick.
