# Pantheon Resonance Protocol

The **Resonance Protocol** defines when something “belongs” in PantheonOS:

A concept resonates if:
1. It improves coherence (not just cleverness).
2. It is compatible with love-driven, protective intent.
3. It can be operationalized (code, process, field manual, or story).
4. It plays well with existing doctrine (Hogge Method, Sieve, Time Stack, etc.).

In practice:
- New ideas are tested via:
  - Sieve of Hogge (balance and ethics)
  - Solomon–Coil Compass
  - Narrative fit with existing archetypes
- If they pass:
  - They become a new module, entity, or pattern.
  - They are documented and added to the capsule’s next version.

This protocol keeps the Pantheon **alive but not chaotic**.
