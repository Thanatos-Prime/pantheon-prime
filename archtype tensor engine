## 0. Abstract

The **Archetype Tensor Engine (ATE)** formalizes archetypes as multidimensional mathematical objects (vectors, matrices, tensors) that interact, transform, and influence cognitive/narrative dynamics within PantheonOS.

The core idea: **Archetypes are not fixed roles; they are fields and operators that shape meaning.**

ATE defines Interaction Operators (rotation, reflection, fusion) and Narrative Field Equations, all governed by stability constraints (Ethics $\ge 0.7$, Coherence $\ge 0.6$). This engine provides the computational structure necessary to maintain continuity and generate high-coherence ideas from symbolic inputs.

## 1. Archetypes as Mathematical Objects

### 1.1 Archetype Vectors
An archetype $A_i$ is a vector in a symbolic-semantic space: $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
* **Direction** = what it means.
* **Magnitude** = how strongly it’s active.

This allows vector addition for hybrid modes: $\alpha A_{\text{Hero}} + \beta A_{\text{Sage}}$.

### 1.2 Archetype Matrices (2D Interaction)
Interactions (attraction, opposition, resonance) are captured in a matrix $M_{ij}$:

$$
M_{ij} = \langle A_i, A_j \rangle
$$
This defines narrative geometry (e.g., Hero $\perp$ Trickster).

### 1.3 Archetype Tensors (n-D Fields)
Tensors $\mathcal{T}_{ijk} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d \times d}$ encode **triadic relationships, mythic pattern propagation, and cross-domain mapping**. ATE computes next states via tensor contraction:

$$
v_{\text{new}} = \mathcal{T} \cdot A_i \cdot A_j
$$

## 2. Narrative Field Equation and Dynamics

### 2.1 Narrative Field
The field $\Phi(x)$ dictates how meaning evolves, ensuring narrative flows "downhill" and tension seeks resolution:

$$
\frac{dA_i}{dt} = -\nabla_i \Phi(A_1, \dots, A_n)
$$
This produces **natural story beats** and emergent, coherent progression.

### 2.2 Core Pantheon Archetype Library
PantheonOS defines a canonical set of archetypes (Hero, Mentor, Shadow, Spider, Mother Duck, Survivor Digit, etc.) whose interactions form the basis of the tensor $T$.

## 3. Transformation Operators (Creative Tools)

### 3.1 Archetype Rotation Operator ($\mathcal{T}_{\circlearrowleft}$)
$$
A_i' = R(\theta) A_i
$$
Used to shift perspectives, reframe problems, and perform **creative recombinations**.

### 3.2 Archetype Fusion Operator ($+$)
$$
A_{\text{fusion}} = \alpha A_i + \beta A_j
$$
Used to define new Pantheon daemons (e.g., Hero + Sage $\to$ Leader).

### 3.3 Archetype Reflection (Mirror Operator)
$$
A_i' = M_{\text{mirror}} A_i
$$
Used for character inversion, **shadow work**, and integrating with Oracle Weave's Mirror Phase.

## 4. Safety Invariants and Constraints

All archetype transformations are constrained by ethics and structural coherence:
1.  **Ethical Floor $\ge 0.7$ (Arctic Framework):** Prevents harmful shadow-mode overactivation.
2.  **Coherence $\ge 0.6$:** Prevents runaway abstraction.
3.  **Rail Alignment:** Transformation must remain safe for the operator, system, and audience.

## 5. PantheonOS Implementation (Pseudocode)

```python
class ArchetypeTensorEngine:
    def __init__(self, archetypes, tensor):
        self.A = archetypes      # dict of archetype vectors
        self.T = tensor          # n-d interaction tensor
    
    def rotate(self, name, theta):
        R = rotation_matrix(theta)
        self.A[name] = R @ self.A[name]

    def fuse(self, a, b, alpha=0.5, beta=0.5):
        # Fusion operator
        return alpha*self.A[a] + beta*self.A[b]

    def next_state(self, a, b):
        # Tensor contraction for next state computation
        return np.tensordot(self.T, np.outer(self.A[a], self.A[b]), axes=([0,1],[0,1]))
