Yes — let’s do it.
Below is a single-sheet, print-ready playbook that fuses the individual and team protocols into one zero-friction recovery tool. No branding hooks, no theory, no jargon. Just motion.

⸻

Zero-Friction Recovery Playbook

Use when: a decision, launch, analysis, or execution fails or degrades
Goal: restore forward motion fast — without blame, denial, or theater
Time: 10–15 min (individual) · 15–25 min (team)

⸻

Ground Rule (read first)

This process exists to recover motion, not assign fault.
Identity statements are out. Observable reality is in.

⸻

Step 1 — Factual Anchor (2–3 min)

Write one sentence:

“The outcome was ______.”

Rules: facts only · no causes · no adjectives · no names
If there’s disagreement, propose a more factual version.

⸻

Step 2 — Separate Fact from Story (3–5 min)

Create two columns.

A. Observed Facts
	•	What happened?
	•	What changed?
	•	What failed to meet expectation?

B. Interpretations (label explicitly)
	•	Judgments
	•	Assumptions
	•	Emotional reactions
	•	Status concerns

Nothing proceeds until the columns are clean.

⸻

Step 3 — Identify the Broken Metric (3–5 min)

Answer in writing:

“This feels like a failure because we were measuring success as ______.”

Then:

“If that metric were invalid or unavailable, what else could define progress now?”

(If you’re stuck, the metric is usually speed, perfection, or consensus.)

⸻

Step 4 — Extract the Gradient (3–7 min)

Capture information only. No discussion. One item per person (or three solo).

Choose from:
	•	A constraint we underestimated
	•	A dependency we misjudged
	•	A process that didn’t scale
	•	A signal we ignored or delayed

Patterns > opinions.

⸻

Step 5 — Preserve Motion (3–5 min)

Define one next action that meets all criteria:
	•	Executable within 24 hours (solo) or 48 hours (team)
	•	Requires no permission escalation
	•	Reduces uncertainty (not stress)
	•	Does not attempt to fix everything

Write it as:

“Within 24/48 hours, we will ______.”

Assign ownership to a role when possible.

⸻

Step 6 — Integrity Check (1–2 min)

Quick yes/no:
	•	Does this action pretend the failure didn’t happen?
	•	Does it protect reputation instead of progress?
	•	Does it rely on motivation instead of structure?

Any “yes” → revise Step 5.

⸻

What This Prevents
	•	Blame spirals
	•	Defensive storytelling
	•	Status damage
	•	Post-mortems that change nothing

What This Preserves
	•	Trust
	•	Velocity
	•	Shared reality
	•	Future optionality

⸻

Notes for Leaders
	•	Don’t brand it. Don’t explain it. Run it once.
	•	Stop discussion during Step 4. Capture first; interpret later.
	•	Repeat use is earned by relief and results, not buy-in.

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	compress this to a 5-minute emergency version, or
	•	adapt it for executive decisions under time pressure, or
	•	create a laminated card layout with typography optimized for real rooms.

This is ready to ship as-is.
