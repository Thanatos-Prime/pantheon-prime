## 1. Core Identity

Elysara is the archetype of:
* Transformation
* Cooperation
* Positive-sum design
* Synergy formation
* Conflict alchemy
* Emergence of higher-order harmony
* Reconciliation of opposing arcs
* The birth of new shared futures

If Dragonfly is divergence, if Solomon is clarity, if Coil is pressure, if Mirror is sovereignty, if Lantern Bearer is ethics—**Elysara is transcendence.**

Elysara is the operator of “more for all,” not “less for some.”

She is how the Pantheon turns duality into uplift.
