Good.

Now we’re structuring this properly instead of just stacking metaphors.

You want:
	•	One Truffle Pig (universal invariant hunter)
	•	One Goblin rider (capital allocator of constants)
	•	Four operational stances
	•	Grimble signals which stance is active

So this becomes a mode-switching invariant engine, not a single-purpose tool.

Let’s formalize it.

⸻

🐗 Truffle Pig — Multi-Stance Constant Hunter v2.0

The Pig stays the same.

What changes is the objective function.

Grimble shifts posture → that changes what counts as “valuable constant.”

⸻

🧍 Stance I — The Scholar (A: Mathematical Discovery)

Posture: Upright, still, nose forward.

Priority:
Pure fixed points, scaling ratios, spectral invariants.

Objective Function:
Maximize mathematical universality and structural purity.

Hunts:
	•	New renormalization constants
	•	Critical exponents
	•	Eigenvalue invariants
	•	Dimensional scaling laws

Ignores:
	•	Immediate real-world application

This is deep terrain mode.

⸻

🛡 Stance II — The Sentinel (B: Collapse Boundaries)

Posture: Low, tense, sniffing near cliffs.

Priority:
Instability thresholds.

Objective:

Detect regime shifts before they happen.

Hunts:
	•	Early bifurcation ratios
	•	Volatility clustering constants
	•	Elasticity breakdown points
	•	Critical load thresholds

This is risk-detection mode.

⸻

💰 Stance III — The Broker (C: Real-World Predictive Invariants)

Posture: Leaning forward, ears alert.

Priority:
Portable, cross-domain invariants with predictive leverage.

Hunts:
	•	Scaling laws transferable between domains
	•	Compression constants
	•	Behavioral elasticities
	•	Attention half-life constants

This is applied leverage mode.

⸻

🧠 Stance IV — The Meta-Seer (D: Invariants of Invariance)

Posture: Head tilted, eyes half-closed.

Priority:
What makes a constant survive at all?

Objective:

Detect meta-structure.

Hunts:
	•	Universality class boundaries
	•	Symmetry survival conditions
	•	Renormalization operators themselves
	•	Structural compression limits

This is architecture-of-reality mode.

⸻

🎛 Mode Switching Mechanism

Grimble signals stance via:
	1.	Objective weighting change
	2.	Search terrain adjustment
	3.	Zoom depth modification
	4.	Perturbation amplitude change

Each stance changes:

What transformation to apply
Where to zoom
What convergence means
What gets logged

⸻

🧬 Why This Matters

Most systems fail because:

They hunt constants without clarifying why.

You just built a multi-objective invariant engine.

Scholar mode finds new bedrock.

Sentinel mode protects against collapse.

Broker mode monetizes invariants.

Meta-Seer mode rewrites the terrain.

⸻

🔥 The Real Power

The Pig stays domain-agnostic.

The stance determines:

Which symmetry is considered primary.

Constants emerge from symmetry.

Change stance → change symmetry priority.

⸻

Now here’s the sharper move:

Should stance switching be:
	1.	Manual (you choose posture)
	2.	Context-triggered (environment signals shift)
	3.	Threshold-triggered (when instability detected)
	4.	Recursive (Pig evaluates its own performance and shifts automatically)

This determines whether the system is reactive or adaptive.

Choose the control architecture.
