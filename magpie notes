Yeah—what you’re noticing is real, and you’re also right about why you’re noticing it.

A few things are happening at once.

First: those languages really do have words that feel impossibly precise.
Japanese, Sanskrit, Greek—each evolved with different pressures:
	•	Sanskrit was engineered for philosophical and metaphysical precision. It’s almost unfair how cleanly it can name inner states, causality, duty, becoming.
	•	Greek got obsessed with distinctions—being vs becoming, truth vs appearance, form vs matter—so it minted words to slice reality finely.
	•	Japanese leans into relational, situational meaning: how something feels in context, in season, between people, in silence.

So when you’re thinking about liminal states, ethics, restraint, timing, meaning—those languages already have grooves worn in exactly that direction. You’re running downhill.

Second: novelty sharpens perception.
Because English is your native language, it’s mostly invisible to you. It’s water. Other languages feel crystalline because you encounter them as objects, not atmosphere.

A non-native English speaker hearing words like:
	•	sonder
	•	serendipity
	•	hindsight
	•	awkward
	•	closure
	•	accountability
	•	fairness

often has the same reaction you’re having now:

“How does this one word hold all of that?”

English just hides its depth in plain sight because you use it automatically.

Third (this one’s subtle): English is a magpie language.
It steals shamelessly.

English doesn’t always invent deep words—it imports them:
	•	Greek roots for abstraction
	•	Latin roots for law and structure
	•	Germanic roots for body, earth, action
	•	French for nuance and social texture

So English ends up with layers rather than single perfect words. Instead of one Sanskrit-style term, it gives you:
	•	a phrase
	•	a metaphor
	•	a workaround
	•	a borrowed word
	•	or a compound

That can feel clumsy—or incredibly flexible, depending on how you’re listening.

Fourth: you’re tuned to meaning density right now.
You’re scanning for words that compress:
	•	ethics
	•	restraint
	•	paradox
	•	timing
	•	inner states
	•	non-zero-sum outcomes

So of course Japanese, Sanskrit, Greek light up. They’re famous for high semantic compression in exactly those domains.

If you were deep into:
	•	logistics
	•	contracts
	•	humor
	•	engineering
	•	social friction
	•	understatement

you might suddenly think, damn, English is weirdly good at this.

Last thing—and this matters:

Languages don’t just name ideas.
They train attention.

When a language has a word for something, it teaches its speakers to notice it. When it doesn’t, the idea still exists—but it floats, unnamed, harder to hold.

So you’re not romanticizing other languages.
You’re recognizing where they carved handles into reality—and noticing which handles English leaves smooth.

And you’re right: to someone else, English is full of beautiful, strange, deep artifacts you barely notice anymore.

That’s not a flaw.
It’s just perspective rotating.

Different faces.
Same god.
