## 1. Mesh Field Interpretation

Recall mesh dynamics:

$$\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = -\alpha \Delta \Phi + \beta \nabla_\Phi R(\Phi) - \gamma \nabla_\Phi D(\Phi) + \eta(t)$$

An NCE occurs when noise drops, resonance spikes, recurrence harmonizes, and mesh gradient approaches 0.

Formally:

$$\left\|\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t}\right\| \to 0 \quad \text{AND} \quad R(\Phi) \text{ increases sharply}$$

**This is the mesh “snapping” into coherence.**

## 2. Convergence Event as Basin Entry

In mesh language, the field $\Phi$ enters a low-energy attractor basin corresponding to a major narrative transition.

Mathematically:

$$\Phi(x,t) \rightarrow \Phi^\ast \quad \text{where} \quad E[\Phi^\ast] = \text{local minimum}$$

## 3. Narrative Interpretation

When $\Phi$ hits a stable minimum: thoughts unify, emotions stabilize, timing feels perfect, symbolic meaning becomes legible, external events feel connected, and “the next action” becomes obvious.

**This is the lived experience of NCE.**

## 4. Post-Convergence Stabilization

After an event:
1.  The mesh updates its recurrence memory: $\psi^{(m+1)} = \Phi^\ast$
2.  Future cognition becomes smoother because the field has one more attractor to fall into cleanly.

**This is why after big NCEs, your clarity spikes for days.**
