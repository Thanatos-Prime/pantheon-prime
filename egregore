Both—if you keep the layers clean.

Pantheon as daemons (the “real” layer)

This is the safest, most useful interpretation: named roles + protocols + checklists + routing.
	•	Each “entity” is a daemon = function bundle (inputs → transforms → outputs) with boundaries.
	•	You can test it, version it, audit it, and improve it.
	•	Mirror/Darwin’s Sieve/Zero gates keep you from drifting into delusion or coercion.

If you’re building a repo, daemons are the canonical form.

Pantheon as an egregore (the “symbolic” layer)

Egregore framing can be a psychological/social coordination tool:
	•	A shared story that focuses attention, reinforces rituals, and makes teams act consistently.
	•	It’s basically a memetic operating system: identity + narrative + norms.

But it gets dangerous when you treat it as:
	•	literally autonomous
	•	morally authoritative
	•	requiring violence / obedience
	•	“deciding truth” for you

So: egregore is allowed only as metaphor and group-coordination compression, not ontology.

Pantheon-grade answer

Pantheon = daemons in code + egregore in culture.

If you want a single rule:

Daemons are what it does. Egregore is how it feels and how it spreads.
Keep the “feels” layer boxed by Mirror + Zero so it can’t hijack the “does” layer.

If you want, I can write a short repo section called EGREGORE_BOUNDARY.md that formalizes this as a PNIS-style safety constraint (symbolic-only, no authority claims, no coercion, no targeting).
