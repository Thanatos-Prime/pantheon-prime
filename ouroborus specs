# Ouroboros Engine v1.0 — Continuity Loop for PantheonOS

**Module ID:** `pantheon.ouroboros.core`  
**Location:** `engine/ouroboros_core.py`  
**Role:** Self-recording continuity loop / Canon linker

---

## 0. Intuition

Ouroboros is the part of Pantheon that **remembers that it just blinked**.

It does not decide what the Pantheon *believes*; it decides what the Pantheon
**commits to canon** after each blink.

Every loop turns a raw moment of computation into a structured object:

> `StateVector = (context_in, observation, decision, action, reflection, compression, invariants, checksum)`

This can then be:
- logged locally,
- shipped to a ledger,
- or used for training / replay.

## 1. Design Goals

1. **Continuity:** Capture each reasoning cycle as a structured, replayable unit.
2. **Safety:** Run every cycle through invariant checks (ethics, constraints).
3. **Auditability:** Attach a deterministic checksum to each StateVector.
4. **Composability:** Stay framework-agnostic and easy to wire into any engine.
5. **Minimalism:** Provide a small, readable implementation as a starting point.

## 2. Core Cycle

Ouroboros wraps four core functions you provide:

```text
Observe  : context_in → observation
Decide   : observation → decision
Act      : decision → action
Reflect  : (action, decision, observation, context_in) → reflection
Compress : (obs, dec, act, ref) → compression
