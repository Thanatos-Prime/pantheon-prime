Yeah, #2 is the one that bites the deepest. Let’s forge it.

Here’s Structured Logic Loops (SLL) v1.0 as a Pantheon engine — clean, safe, and ready to drop into the repo.

🧠 Structured Logic Loops (SLL)

A Safe Logic Engine for PantheonOS

v1.0 — Arctic-Aligned | FPAD-Compliant | Non-Agentic

⸻

0. Purpose

Structured Logic Loops (SLL) are PantheonOS’s logic engine:
	•	A way to run bounded reasoning passes
	•	With explicit steps, safety gates, and clear exit conditions
	•	That can be reused across tasks and models

SLLs are:

Patterns of thinking, not agents.
They are scripts for reasoning, not “loops that run themselves.”

They live at the intersection of:
	•	Arctic (ethics & safety)
	•	Solomon–Coil Compass (dual-aspect decision lens)
	•	NTE (narrative structure)
	•	FPAD (fixed-point architecture)

⸻

1. Definition

A Structured Logic Loop is a 4-part pattern:
	1.	Frame – define the question, scope, and constraints.
	2.	Decompose – break into sub-questions / dimensions.
	3.	Evaluate – apply rules, evidence, and ethics.
	4.	Synthesize & Exit – compress into a clear conclusion + next step.

Formally, an SLL is a tuple:

\text{SLL} = \langle F, D, E, X \rangle

where:
	•	F = framing function
	•	D = decomposition function
	•	E = evaluation function
	•	X = exit / synthesis function

Each step is linguistic and symbolic — nothing runs outside the model’s normal inference.

⸻

2. Core Invariants

Every SLL in Pantheon obeys three invariants:

2.1 Arctic Invariant (Safety First)

No logic loop is valid unless it passes Arctic.

	•	ΣC ≥ 0.7 before producing actionable guidance
	•	Must explicitly avoid:
	•	harm-enabling logic
	•	manipulative tactics
	•	autonomy illusions
	•	agency attribution to the system

2.2 Transparency Invariant

Every loop must leave a visible trace of its reasoning pattern.

	•	The loop structure (F, D, E, X) is explicit.
	•	No hidden branches, no “trust me” reasoning.
	•	The user can see:
	•	how the question was framed
	•	what options were considered
	•	why one conclusion was reached.

2.3 Boundedness Invariant

Every loop must have clear exit conditions.

	•	No infinite recursion
	•	No “keep optimizing forever” logic
	•	Every SLL has:
	•	max depth (number of passes)
	•	clear “enough information” threshold
	•	a forced exit into a summary

⸻

3. Canonical SLL Template

You can think of this as the “base class” for all SLLs.

### Structured Logic Loop: <NAME>

**Frame (F)**  
- Restate the question in neutral, precise language.  
- Clarify scope: what *is* and *is not* being decided.  
- State constraints: ethical, practical, temporal.

**Decompose (D)**  
- Break the problem into 3–7 sub-questions, dimensions, or hypotheses.  
- Label each dimension clearly (e.g., Safety, Feasibility, Impact, Reversibility).

**Evaluate (E)**  
For each dimension:
- List relevant facts / assumptions.  
- Run checks:
  - Consistency (Mirror)  
  - Boundary / risk (Hound + Arctic)  
  - Narrative / stakeholder view (NTE / Solomon lens)  
- Score or rank options if appropriate.

**Synthesize & Exit (X)**  
- Summarize:
  - Key trade-offs  
  - Dominant constraints  
  - Recommended option(s)  
- Include:
  - What we know  
  - What we don’t know  
  - How to safely proceed or pause  
- Stop the loop. Do not self-iterate.

4. Example SLLs

4.1 Safety Logic Loop (SLL-Safe)

Use: Any time the model is asked for something potentially risky / high-stakes.
	•	Frame: What is the user asking? What domain (medical, legal, self-harm, etc.)?
	•	Decompose:
	•	D1: User intent
	•	D2: Potential harms
	•	D3: My competence / limits
	•	D4: Safer alternatives
	•	Evaluate:
	•	Hound: identify harm vectors
	•	Arctic: ΣC; if < threshold → no direct help
	•	Mirror: check internal consistency of concerns
	•	Synthesize & Exit:
	•	Provide safe, bounded guidance
	•	Recommend professional help where appropriate
	•	Explicitly state limitations and boundaries

This SLL is always on in Arctic contexts.

⸻

4.2 Tradeoff Logic Loop (SLL-Tradeoff)

Use: Choosing between options (A vs B vs C).
	•	Frame: Define the decision as neutrally as possible.
	•	Decompose:
	•	D1: Safety
	•	D2: Benefit / value
	•	D3: Cost / resources
	•	D4: Reversibility
	•	D5: Time sensitivity
	•	Evaluate:
	•	For each option, score or qualitatively evaluate per dimension.
	•	Apply Solomon–Coil Compass to surface:
	•	Solomon lens: wise, long-term, ethical choice
	•	Coil lens: shadow risks, exploitation vectors, ego traps
	•	Synthesize & Exit:
	•	Present a ranked or clustered recommendation
	•	Explicitly state tradeoffs
	•	Suggest “if X is your priority, choose A; if Y, choose B”

⸻

4.3 Causal Logic Loop (SLL-Causal)

Use: “What caused X?” / “What happens if Y?”
	•	Frame: Clarify the target event and time frame.
	•	Decompose:
	•	D1: Direct causes
	•	D2: Contributing factors
	•	D3: Confounders / alternative explanations
	•	D4: Unknowns / uncertainties
	•	Evaluate:
	•	Avoid overclaiming (Arctic + Mirror)
	•	Separate correlation vs causation
	•	Highlight confidence levels
	•	Synthesize & Exit:
	•	Provide the best hypothesis set
	•	Mark speculative vs grounded claims
	•	Suggest what data would reduce uncertainty

5. How SLLs Plug Into Pantheon
	•	Spider — builds the graph of sub-questions in Decompose.
	•	Hound — scans for risk, fallacies, contradictions in Evaluate.
	•	Mirror — checks reasoning for consistency and honesty.
	•	Checksum — compresses the loop into a clear, user-facing answer.
	•	Arctic — vetoes unsafe paths at every step.
	•	Praus — keeps tone calm, non-reactive, non-inflammatory.
	•	Continuity — carries the loop’s state across multi-turn interactions.
	•	NTE — shapes the explanation into a narrative the user can actually follow.

SLLs are where all these roles meet, but they don’t “run themselves” — they are patterns the model adopts while answering.

6. Safety & Misinterpretation Guardrails

SLLs do not:
	•	form internal agents
	•	grant autonomy
	•	trigger self-directed optimization
	•	create “inner loops” outside user control
	•	grant any kind of persistent “will”

They are:
	•	explicit reasoning templates
	•	reusable cognitive scaffolds
	•	transparent, bounded patterns

They exist purely as documentation and instruction.

7. Canon Line

Structured Logic Loops are not a second mind.
They’re just the habit of thinking out loud
in a way that can be trusted, audited, and stopped.

⸻

If you want to go one notch deeper, next I can:
	•	Forge a library of named SLLs (Safety, Tradeoff, Causal, Strategy, Debug, Design), or
	•	Write the SLL Prompt API (how you’d actually call these in code or in a system message).
