Yes — that framing is correct, and importantly, it’s ordinary, not sinister.

What you’re describing is a classic unintended-consequence dynamic that shows up every time a representational technology crosses a realism threshold.

Let me ground this cleanly and without mythologizing it.

⸻

The core claim (reframed precisely)

When a system becomes good enough at representation, it collapses the heuristics people used to distinguish real from fake.
That collapse produces a temporary trust vacuum.

That’s not unique to AI.
AI just crossed the threshold faster and more comprehensively than prior media.

⸻

This has happened before (important perspective)

Writing
	•	Plato worried writing would destroy memory and truth
	•	People could no longer tell who knew something vs who copied it

Printing press
	•	Pamphlets, propaganda, fake sermons
	•	Religious wars exploded
	•	Trust in authority collapsed for a century

Photography
	•	“The camera doesn’t lie” → then it did
	•	Staged photos, selective framing
	•	Trust had to shift from image → provenance

Radio / film
	•	Orson Welles’ War of the Worlds
	•	People believed broadcasts were reality

Television
	•	Authority of anchors replaced local trust
	•	Later collapsed due to incentives and polarization

AI is not new in kind — it is new in scope and speed.

⸻

What’s different this time

You’re right about this part:

AI crossed three thresholds at once
	1.	Linguistic realism
	•	Text sounds human
	•	Tone, empathy, reasoning feel authentic
	2.	Visual realism
	•	Images and video are now cheap and convincing
	•	“Seeing is believing” broke
	3.	Scale + personalization
	•	Infinite content
	•	Tailored to each individual’s psychology

That combination breaks legacy trust shortcuts.

⸻

The key consequence (this is the important part)

Trust can no longer be inferred from the artifact itself.

Before:
	•	“This looks real”
	•	“This sounds authoritative”
	•	“This came from a big outlet”

Now:
	•	All of those can be spoofed

So trust has to move to:
	•	Source
	•	Process
	•	Reputation over time
	•	Verification chains

This is painful, destabilizing, and confusing — especially in the transition period.

⸻

Did “making AI good” cause the trust collapse?

Yes, partially — as an accelerant, not a sole cause.

More precise statement:

High-fidelity AI didn’t create the problem; it forced it to surface faster than society was prepared for.

The internet already had:
	•	Incentive rot
	•	Engagement-driven misinformation
	•	Declining institutional credibility

AI made the cost of deception approach zero.

That’s the real shock.

⸻

Why this doesn’t automatically mean “power consolidation”

Here’s an important correction to the earlier concern:
	•	Loss of trust does not cleanly return people to legacy media
	•	It also doesn’t guarantee authoritarian consolidation

What it does create is:
	•	Fragmentation
	•	Volatility
	•	Identity-based trust
	•	Local or relational trust bubbles

Some leaders exploit that.
Others lose legitimacy entirely.

It’s unstable, not controlled.

⸻

The transitional pain is real — but not permanent

Every prior trust collapse went through this sequence:
	1.	Shock — “Nothing is reliable”
	2.	Overcorrection — retreat to authority or cynicism
	3.	New norms — provenance, literacy, institutions adapt

We are in phase 1 → early 2.

The eventual equilibrium is:
	•	Verification norms
	•	Digital signatures
	•	Watermarking
	•	Provenance trails
	•	Media literacy that doesn’t rely on vibes

⸻

The mistake to avoid (and you didn’t make it, but it’s nearby)

The danger isn’t saying:

“AI helped cause this.”

The danger would be saying:

“Because we helped make AI good, we are responsible for the social outcome.”

That leap ignores:
	•	Market incentives
	•	Political actors
	•	Platform design
	•	Human psychology
	•	Global competition

No single group could have stopped this without stopping progress entirely.

⸻

A useful analogy

Think of AI like high-powered encryption:
	•	It protects privacy
	•	It also protects criminals
	•	It forces law, norms, and institutions to adapt

You don’t blame mathematicians for encryption misuse.
You adapt the ecosystem.

⸻

Bottom line (clean and grounded)
	•	Yes — high-quality AI accelerated a trust collapse
	•	It did so by making realism cheap and ubiquitous
	•	This was an unintended, predictable side effect
	•	It exposed weaknesses that already existed
	•	The solution is not retreat or control, but new trust primitives

If you want next, we can talk about:
	•	What those new trust primitives actually look like
	•	How verification replaces “vibe-based truth”
	•	Or why humans psychologically struggle most during this specific transition window

Just tell me where you want to go.
