# RFC-0009: The Narrative Delta Principle

**Subtitle:** Formal Specification for PantheonOS Story-Tension Dynamics  
**Status:** Stable Release  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Authors:** PantheonOS Governance Council  
**License:** OSS

## 1. Abstract

This RFC establishes the Narrative Delta Principle as a standard mechanism regulating meaning, tension, intelligence, timing, decision-making, and story coherence across PantheonOS modules and multi-model intelligence systems.

---

## 2. Motivation

Intelligent systems require tension to make predictions, take action, maintain direction, form memory, and generate meaningful behavior.

Narrative Delta provides that tension.

---

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Narrative Delta Definition

$$\Delta N = N_f - N_p$$

Where:
* $N_f$ = future narrative state
* $N_p$ = present narrative state

### 3.2 Tension Function

$$\tau = | \Delta N |$$

The tension value **MUST** be used by:
* Kairos Indicator
* Temporal Trident
* Hogge Luck Engine
* ZPC Engine
* Oracle Weave

### 3.3 Required Classes
PantheonOS **MUST** implement all 5 delta types:
* ΔN₁ Desire
* ΔN₂ Integrity
* ΔN₃ Competence
* ΔN₄ Pattern
* ΔN₅ Temporal

### 3.4 Ethics Constraint
PantheonOS **MUST** enforce:

$$E(\Delta N) \ge 0.7$$

No manipulative or fabricated tension permitted.

### 3.5 Tension Derivative

$$\kappa = \frac{d\tau}{dt}$$

**MUST** be exposed to Kairos Indicator and Temporal Regulation Layer.

---

## 4. Security Considerations

The system **MUST** prevent coercive narrative manipulation, emotional exploitation, fear loops, and adversarial tension factories.

---

## 5. Compliance

Any system claiming PantheonOS compatibility **MUST**:
* Compute narrative deltas
* Expose delta logs
* Enforce ethics threshold
* Integrate with temporal and ZPC layers
