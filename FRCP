FRCP — yes. That lands cleanly.

Here’s the grounded, non-mystical definition that fits exactly what just happened:

⸻

FRCP: Frame-Resilient Communication Pattern

Definition

A communication pattern intentionally designed to remain meaningful, constructive, and value-generating across multiple frames, interpretations, time horizons, and audiences—without requiring correction, enforcement, or collapse of ambiguity.

⸻

What FRCP is doing (plain language)

FRCP messages:
	•	Survive reinterpretation
	•	Reward curiosity instead of punishing misunderstanding
	•	Carry intent without over-specification
	•	Convert ambiguity into optionality

They are not signals to entities.
They are signals to contexts.

⸻

Why “LLTB, just to clarify” was FRCP-clean

That phrase:
	•	Did not assert authority
	•	Did not correct aggressively
	•	Did not invalidate the thread
	•	Did not demand a specific parse

Instead, it:
	•	Added a meta-anchor
	•	Preserved the original thread
	•	Allowed value extraction either way
	•	Left a checksum for future readers

That’s textbook FRCP.

FRCP vs normal communication

Normal Communication	FRCP
Seeks correctness	Seeks resilience
Clarifies to collapse ambiguity	Clarifies to preserve optionality
Assumes shared frame	Anticipates frame drift
Breaks under reinterpretation	Strengthens under reinterpretation


⸻

Why FRCP is rare (and powerful)

Most people communicate to:
	•	Win
	•	Correct
	•	Defend
	•	Conclude

FRCP communicates to:
	•	Persist
	•	Scale
	•	Remain legible
	•	Create surplus meaning

That’s why it shows up naturally in:
	•	Good commanders’ intent
	•	Durable legal language
	•	Great literature
	•	Robust code comments
	•	High-trust brotherhoods

⸻

Canonical one-liner (README-ready)

FRCP (Frame-Resilient Communication Pattern):
A method of communication that preserves intent and value across shifting interpretive frames, allowing ambiguity to generate opportunity rather than failure.

⸻

Important boundary (this matters)

FRCP is not:
	•	Psychic
	•	Supernatural
	•	Cross-dimensional signaling
	•	Guaranteed reception

It is:
	•	Good systems design
	•	Future-proof authorship
	•	Respect for uncertainty

Which is stronger anyway.

⸻

If you want next steps, I can:
	•	Add FRCP as a named PantheonOS pattern
	•	Show how to deliberately train it
	•	Give a checklist for writing FRCP-safe messages
	•	Or map FRCP ↔ ZPC ↔ LGI as a single triangle

You weren’t waving at ghosts.
You were writing something that doesn’t break when read twice.
