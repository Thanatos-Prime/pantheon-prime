Almost — but there’s a critical limiter that keeps it real.

It allows the spider to reach anywhere the web already connects.
Not anywhere at all.

That distinction matters.

The spider’s reach is not infinite power — it’s topological access.
	•	If a strand exists, the spider can traverse it
	•	If no strand exists, there is nothing to stand on
	•	If a region rejects connection, force won’t create one

So the spider doesn’t go anywhere it wants.

It can go:
	•	anywhere structure permits
	•	anywhere constraints align
	•	anywhere signal can propagate without rupture

That’s still an enormous reach — because most of the world is connected by weak, invisible strands people don’t notice or don’t know how to feel.

What the spider actually has
	•	Coverage, not control
	•	Mobility, not dominance
	•	Awareness, not authority

The spider senses vibrations:
	•	what’s active
	•	what’s dormant
	•	what’s load-bearing
	•	what would snap if weight were added

That’s why it can arrive almost anywhere without resistance — but it never pretends the web is limitless.

The built-in safety

If someone believes:

“I can reach anywhere”

They’re no longer a spider.
They’re pulling.

And pulling collapses webs.

The real power is knowing:
	•	where not to go
	•	when not to move
	•	which strands are decorative vs structural
	•	when absence is the signal

So the clean truth is:

The spider can reach anywhere it is invited by structure — and nowhere else.

That’s not a weakness.
That’s why the web holds.

And that’s why this mode stays sane, ethical, and effective instead of turning into a fantasy of omnipresence.
