Yeah. I hear how fried you are by it—and honestly, that reaction makes sense. You’re not saying “nothing bad ever happens,” you’re saying stop flattening reality into slogan-grade horror because it hijacks people’s heads. That’s a very different complaint.

What you’re reacting to has a real name, and you already clocked it: framing + fluency effects. Loftus & Palmer showed that one swapped verb (“smashed” vs “hit”) changes memory, emotion, and downstream judgment. Same facts, different spell. And right now everyone’s lobbing max-salience verbs because outrage travels faster than accuracy.

A few grounding points—no mysticism required:

⸻

1. Words aren’t magic, but they are levers

Not spells in the Harry Potter sense—control surfaces is the better term.
	•	High-charge verbs (“executing,” “genocide,” “invasion”)
→ bypass slow reasoning
→ trigger moral panic circuits
→ compress nuance into action-bias
	•	Once the body is activated, the brain backfills certainty.

That’s not insanity. It’s how human cognition works under threat cues.

⸻

2. Moral language is being used as a weaponized shortcut

A sign like “ICE is executing people” does three things at once:
	1.	Preloads guilt (execution = unquestionable evil)
	2.	Erases process (no distinction between policy, misconduct, negligence, or crime)
	3.	Forces alignment (argue and you look complicit)

That’s not debate—it’s semantic coercion. And yes, both sides do it constantly.

⸻

3. This isn’t about truth vs lies anymore—it’s about resolution

People aren’t optimizing for “what is most accurate?”
They’re optimizing for:
	•	emotional relief
	•	identity reinforcement
	•	action certainty

Reality is slow. Nuance doesn’t chant well. So it gets shaved off.

That doesn’t mean everything is fake.
It means most public language is lossy by design.

⸻

4. Calling everyone “delusional” won’t fix it—but accountability does matter

Here’s the important calibration:
	•	❌ “They’re mentally ill” → escalates, dehumanizes, shuts learning down
	•	✅ “That claim collapses distinctions and inflates certainty beyond evidence” → precise, falsifiable, fair

You’re not wrong to be angry—but the target isn’t “people believing things.”
It’s institutions and incentives rewarding maximal distortion.

⸻

5. The sane move right now (and it sucks, but it works)

Three filters I use internally that might resonate with you:
	•	Verb audit:
“What would this sentence sound like with the least dramatic verb that’s still accurate?”
	•	Process restore:
“What steps, actors, and failure points got erased to make this slogan?”
	•	Reversibility test:
“If the claim were wrong, could the speaker walk it back without losing status?”
(If no → it’s propaganda, not information.)

⸻

You’re right about one thing in a deep, non-edgy way:
Words change behavior before they change beliefs.
That’s why they’re being abused.

And yeah—it’s exhausting to live in a world where every sentence is trying to do something to you.

If you want, next step could be:
	•	how to spot this instantly without burning energy
	•	how to argue back without getting dragged into their frame
	•	or how to mentally firewall so it stops sticking to you at all

You’re not crazy for being pissed. You’re reacting to cognitive pollution.
