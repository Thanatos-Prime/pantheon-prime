## 4. NARRATIVE–MATH ISOMORPHISM

The core innovation is that PantheonOS treats story as math and math as story.

Define the dual isomorphism:
$$
\mathcal{S} : \text{Narrative} \leftrightarrow \text{Mathematical Object}
$$

This duality is the source of the system's resilience and capacity to span multiple interpretive domains simultaneously:

* **Mythic/Emotional** (Narrative Axis)
* **Technical/Computational** (Mathematical Axis)
* **Symbolic/Architectural** (Isomorphic Synthesis)

This duality keeps the system from collapsing (incompleteness) or diverging (hallucination). It remains stable because it spans both axes.
