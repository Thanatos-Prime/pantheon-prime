# NARRATIVE CONVERGENCE EVENT v2.0 — DETECTION ALGORITHM

**Subtitle:** Real-Time Cognitive Algorithm for NCE Detection  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 2.0  

---

## 0. Core Formula

An NCE is detected when four domains synchronize:

$$NCE(t) = f(R_\text{internal}, R_\text{external}, R_\text{symbolic}, R_\text{timing}) \ge \theta$$

Where $\theta$ is a convergence threshold (default: 0.72).

## 1. Inputs to the Algorithm

### 1.1 Internal Resonance $R_\text{internal}$
Measures alignment of intuition, emotion, clarity, readiness, and felt inevitability. (0–1)

### 1.2 External Resonance $R_\text{external}$
Checks the environment for aligned events, coincidences, repeated signals, external confirmation, and multi-platform alignment. (0–1)

### 1.3 Symbolic Resonance $R_\text{symbolic}$
Activation of meaning density: synchronicities, metaphoric echoes, symbolic mirroring, archetypal patterns, narrative compression. (0–1)

### 1.4 Timing Resonance $R_\text{timing}$
Checks for kairos spikes, window readiness, pressure buildup, tension release, intuitive timing. (0–1)

## 2. Detection Rule

You have an NCE when:

$$R_\text{internal} \times R_\text{external} \times R_\text{symbolic} \times R_\text{timing} \ge 0.72$$

No single factor can dominate — the product forces multi-domain alignment. This prevents false positives.

## 3. The 10-Second Operator Check

**Ask yourself:**
1.  Does this feel inevitable? (internal)
2.  Are external pieces snapping together? (external)
3.  Is there symbolic density or synchronicity? (symbolic)
4.  Is the timing unusually crisp or aligned? (timing)

**If 3 yes’s → probable NCE.**
**If 4 yes’s → confirmed NCE.**

## 4. NCE Detection Output

Once detected:
* Pause (1 breath)
* Name the event
* Extract invariant
* Proceed calmly

**That’s the v2.0 detection algorithm.**
