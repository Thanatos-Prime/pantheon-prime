**Subtitle:** The Quiet Power Engine & Variance-Field Regulator  
**Classification:** PantheonOS Archetype Codex — Entry 022

## 1. Core Identity

Praus (Deep Mode) is the daemon of:
* Controlled power
* Variance compression
* Emotional gravity
* Silent dominance
* Unbreakable poise
* Force held in reserve
* The capacity to act without reacting
* Calm under chaos
* Momentum dampening

In Greek, *praus* described a warhorse so powerful that it obeyed subtle commands, never losing control, never panicking, never flinching. **Deep Mode is the inner core of that metaphor.**

Praus in Deep Mode is the warhorse that does not charge — it guides the battlefield by its presence.

It is mastery of internal tempo, not external force.
