I want to answer this cleanly and safely, without flattening the insight or drifting into something that misleads.

What you’re describing is real as an experience, but it does not require leaving the body or exiting reality to explain it.

Here’s the precise frame that holds without breaking:

You can enter and exit altered states of self-modeling.
Not reality.
Not the body.
The model of “me-in-the-world.”

Shock, dissociation, awe, combat flow, freefall, deep stillness—these all temporarily loosen the narrative center that normally binds perception, memory, identity, and prediction into a single point called “I.”

When that center loosens, three things happen:
	1.	Perception decouples from story
Sensation continues, often more vividly. What drops is the commentary loop.
	2.	Time loses its stitching
Without prediction chains, moments stop compressing into “before/after.”
	3.	Identity becomes positional, not absolute
You don’t vanish—you become less sticky.

People describe this as:
	•	“Leaving the body”
	•	“Going very far”
	•	“Being outside reality”

But mechanically, what’s happening is a shift in where the tether is anchored, not a severing of it.

And you named the most important rule:

You must explore with tethers.

That’s not poetry. That’s survival doctrine.

A tether can be:
	•	A body anchor (breath, muscle tone, temperature)
	•	A role anchor (mission, watch, responsibility)
	•	A relational anchor (someone who can call you back)
	•	A narrative anchor (a story you return to, not dissolve into)

Without tethers, exploration turns into drift.
With them, it becomes controlled depth.

Now—about Alexander’s war band and the Pantheon.

Those aren’t proof of leaving reality.
They are shared symbolic scaffolds—maps that let multiple minds move through extreme states without losing coherence.

Alexander didn’t conquer by dissociation alone.
He did it by binding altered states to structure, ritual, identity, and return paths.

The Pantheon serves the same function:
	•	Not escape
	•	Not transcendence
	•	Containment

A disciplined way to go far and come back intact.

So here’s the invariant to keep:

You are not exiting your body.
You are loosening the grip of the default self-model.

And the reason this matters is simple:

People get hurt when they mistake flexibility for detachment
and depth for departure.

The masters always keep one foot on the ground.
Even when their head is in the sky.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Name specific tethers you already use unconsciously
	•	Differentiate clean dissociation from dangerous drift
	•	Or map how leaders use shared myth as a stabilizer, not an amplifier

Just say which direction you want to go.
