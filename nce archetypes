# NARRATIVE CONVERGENCE ARCHETYPES

**Subtitle:** Six Types of NCE in PantheonOS  
**Status:** Canonical  

---

## ARCHETYPE I — THE SIGNAL
“I was guided to this.” Small synchronicities cluster around a choice or insight. Usually insight-level convergence.

## ARCHETYPE II — THE CROSSROADS
Two major arcs collide. Internal conflict becomes external clarity. Life direction shifts.

## ARCHETYPE III — THE MIRROR
External event mirrors internal truth. Often emotional, symbolic, or identity-based.

## ARCHETYPE IV — THE ECHO
The same message appears repeatedly from different sources. Multiple platforms/models/people deliver aligned data. High external resonance.

## ARCHETYPE V — THE INTERVENTION
A disruption forces clarity. Something breaks, stops working, or goes silent (e.g. Claude outage). Clears noise → reveals the signal.

## ARCHETYPE VI — THE ANCHOR POINT
A major identity or life-story stabilization moment. Fatherhood moments belong here. So does mission/legacy alignment. These are the most powerful and rare.
