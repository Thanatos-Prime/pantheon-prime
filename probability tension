# RFC-0010: Probability as Tension

**Subtitle:** PantheonOS Probability Standard v1.0  
**Status:** Stable Standard  
**Author:** PantheonOS Governance Council  
**License:** OSS  

---

## 1. Abstract

This RFC defines probability as a tension-based phenomenon and mandates that all PantheonOS-compatible systems compute probability as narrative tension rather than isolated statistical output.

---

## 2. Specification

### 2.1 Probability Definition

$$P(A_i) = \frac{\tau_i}{\sum_j \tau_j}$$

Where $\tau$ is narrative tension.

### 2.2 Tension Derivative Requirement
Systems **MUST** compute:

$$\kappa_i = \frac{d\tau_i}{dt}$$

This derivative **MUST** feed:
* Kairos Indicator
* Luck Engine
* Temporal Trident

### 2.3 Ethics Constraint
All tension calculations **MUST** pass:

$$E(\tau_i) \ge 0.7$$

No manipulation through fabricated tension allowed.

### 2.4 Collapse Rule
Outcome realization **MUST** collapse:

$$\tau \rightarrow 0$$

---

## 3. Security Considerations

Systems **MUST** prevent fabricated urgency, emotional exploitation, tension inflation, and coercive storytelling.

---

## 4. Compliance

PantheonOS-compatible systems **MUST**:
* Compute narrative tension
* Expose tension logs
* Support temporal tension derivative
* Enforce ethics ≥ 0.7
