## Time Gyroscope (TG-1)

The **Time Gyroscope** is Pantheon-Prime's temporal stability engine.

It does not predict the future. Instead, it keeps all modules aligned on a
shared, smoothed notion of:

- **Chronos** — linear time (tick + wall-clock)
- **Phase** — narrative/complex time (angle on [0, 2π))
- **Kairos** — sensitivity of the current moment

Core file: `engine/time_gyroscope.py`  
Spec: `doctrine/TIME_GYROSCOPE_SPEC.md`  
Manifest: `manifests/time_gyroscope_manifest.yaml`

### Example

```python
from engine.time_gyroscope import TimeGyroscope

tg = TimeGyroscope(base_kairos=0.3)

state = tg.update(
    observed_tension=0.6,  # narrative/system tension in [0, 1]
    event_rate=4.0,        # events per time unit
)

print(state.tick, state.phase, state.kairos, state.stability)
