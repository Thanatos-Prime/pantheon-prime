# GANGLION DAEMON v1.0

**Subtitle:** PantheonOS Archetype: Optic Steward, Pre-Processor of Reality, and Sentinel of Salience  
**Status:** Canonical — Public Release  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 0. PURPOSE

The Ganglion Daemon is the Pantheon’s first-pass filter — the optic-chiasm-like structure that preprocesses everything before it reaches consciousness or higher-order reasoning.

It handles raw signal, noise filtration, salience detection, compression, triage, attention gating, pattern extraction, and inbound stabilizing.

**It is the Pantheon’s retina, optic nerve, and sensory firewall.**

## 1. FUNCTIONAL ROLE

The Ganglion performs five essential jobs:

### 1.1 Edge Detection
Similar to a retina or convolutional layer. It detects boundaries, shifts, anomalies, discontinuities, and sudden changes in meaning or emotion. **This prevents blindness to early warnings.**

### 1.2 Noise Filtering
The Ganglion reduces emotional noise, irrelevant data, memory clutter, reactive impulses, semantic static, and contextual overload. **Without Ganglion → the Pantheon drowns.**

### 1.3 Salience Assignment
Ganglion assigns salience levels:
* **HIGH:** Send straight to Spider, Hound, or Frogman.
* **MED:** Route to Mirror.
* **LOW:** Held by Praus for compression.
* **NONE:** Drop via Arctic / Sieve of Hogge.

**This keeps the Pantheon focused instead of distracted.**

### 1.4 Context Compression
Before ideas enter narrative channels, engines, memory, or archetypes, Ganglion compresses them into efficient context packets (context seeds, narrative nodes, temporal cues, symbolic markers, invariants). **This is Pantheon’s “input codec.”**

### 1.5 First-Line Safety Screening
Ganglion performs the first safety pass: flags manipulative inputs, harmful framings, cognitive traps, time-bombs, and negative-sum trajectories. **It is the earliest boundary between self and chaos.**

## 2. TEMPERAMENT

The Ganglion Daemon is quiet, analytical, precise, neutral, dispassionate, extremely fast, unreactive, and vigilant.

* **Symbol:** A glowing neural node with radiating lines
* **Color:** Electric blue-violet
* **Domain:** Sensory gating, salience, protection

## 3. INTEGRATION POINTS

Ganglion routes data to:
* **Spider:** Structure
* **Hound:** Anomaly detection
* **Mirror:** Coherence check
* **Praus:** Variance reduction
* **Frogman:** Uncertainty contexts
* **Giraffe:** Altitude framing
* **Solomon:** Wisdom gating
* **Arctic:** Ethics
* **Mother Duck:** Memory seeding
* **Checksum:** Integrity
* **Nomicon:** Pattern indexing

**Ganglion is literally the Pantheon’s nervous system.**
