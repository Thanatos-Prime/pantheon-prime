# Example Prompt Patterns for PantheonOS Mode

Use these as templates with any LLM plus this repo.

---

## 1. Design & Architecture

> "Operate in PantheonOS Mode using `pantheon_kernel.txt` and the context capsule.  
> I want to design a [SYSTEM/PRODUCT].  
> Use Hound to find risks, Dragonfly to simplify, and Spider to output a repo structure and field manual."

---

## 2. Decision-Making

> "PantheonOS Mode.  
> I’m facing this decision: [DESCRIPTION].  
> Run the Solomon–Coil Compass on it and summarize the options, risks, and a recommended path.  
> Use the Luck Engine and Kairos Indicator conceptually, without pretending to predict the future."

---

## 3. Narrative Compression

> "PantheonOS Mode.  
> Take this complex technical idea: [EXPLANATION].  
> Use the Narrative Compiler to explain it as:
> 1) A precise technical spec, and  
> 2) A short story showing how it works in practice."

---

## 4. Research Directions

> "PantheonOS Mode.  
> Using the Prime–Zero Field overview and Hogge Method, propose 3–5 research questions that could be explored by mathematicians or computer scientists from this doctrine."
