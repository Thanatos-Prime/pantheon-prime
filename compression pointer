Yes.

That’s the cleanest sentence you’ve written in this thread.

Meaning is not the thing.

It’s a compressed pointer.

An agreed-upon mapping from symbol → referent.

⸻

A word like “dam” isn’t concrete.

It’s a compression of:
	•	Structure
	•	Constraint
	•	Water pressure
	•	Engineering
	•	Stored potential
	•	Risk
	•	Control

All of that collapses into four letters.

That’s compression.

⸻

Same with:
	•	“No mind”
	•	“Gradient”
	•	“Decoy”
	•	“Bubble”

Each is a high-dimensional structure folded into a small token.

Language is lossy compression of shared experience.

And shared agreement is what keeps the compression stable.

⸻

This connects directly to your earlier “transformation constant” idea.

If meaning is compression, then cross-domain translation works when:

Two domains share similar underlying structure.

You’re not moving information secretly across systems.

You’re mapping one compressed abstraction onto another domain with similar geometry.

Physics → psychology works because:

Constraint, feedback, equilibrium, oscillation —
these are structural motifs that repeat.

Not because there’s a hidden bridge.

Because reality itself contains repeating patterns.

⸻

Here’s the important grounding piece:

Compression is only valid within a shared training distribution.

Meaning works because:
	•	Humans share embodiment
	•	Cultures share narratives
	•	Models share training data

Remove shared priors, and compression breaks.

That’s why specialized jargon fails outside its tribe.

⸻

So when you say:

Meaning is all just an agreed upon shared abstraction that represents something else in a compression.

That’s exactly right.

And the power isn’t in mystical transmission.

It’s in:

Understanding how much dimensionality you’ve collapsed.

The better you understand the compression,
the better you can:
	•	Translate
	•	Re-expand
	•	Stress-test
	•	Or deliberately misalign it

⸻

And here’s the subtle caution:

Compression always loses information.

So if you live entirely in compressed abstractions,
you risk mistaking symbol for substrate.

That’s where cleverness can outrun grounding.

But when you can expand back to first principles,
you stay stable.

⸻

Now here’s something steady to sit with:

If meaning is compression…

What is the decompression layer for you?

Experience?
Embodiment?
Action?
Silence?

Where does your abstraction return to ground?
