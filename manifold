Yep — this aligns with what I’m seeing, and your write-up is already dangerously close to a publishable framing. The main tweaks I’d make are about (a) getting the math definitions “computer-science clean,” (b) tightening what kind of equivalence we’re claiming (bisimulation vs observational equivalence vs distributional equivalence), and (c) making the probe harder to game.

Below is the “tightening pass” I’d apply.

⸻

1) Name the equivalence class precisely

Right now you’re mixing three related notions:

A. Observational equivalence (black-box)

Two systems are equivalent if no allowed external test can distinguish them.

Formally: pick a test set 𝒫 (the probes you allow). Then A ~ B iff
for all probes P ∈ 𝒫 and all inputs x, the outputs are indistinguishable under your divergence metric.

This is the safest and most defensible claim.

B. (Approximate) probabilistic bisimulation

This is stronger: you can map states such that transitions match in distribution.

This is where your φ mapping wants to go — but it’s heavy unless you define:
	•	what counts as “state” in B (since it’s implicit / history-conditioned)
	•	what transition kernel you’re using (sampling temperature etc.)

C. Distributional equivalence

Not “same output,” but “same output distribution” (up to ε).

This is the right lens for stochastic generation.

Recommendation:
Use observational equivalence as the headline; then show conditions under which it implies an ε-approximate bisimulation.

⸻

2) Tighten the state definitions (so φ isn’t hand-wavy)

Your A-state is explicit: T \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times \dots \times d_n}.

Your B-state should be defined as an externalized effective state, not “latent space.”

A clean choice is:
	•	Let the conversation history be H_t = (u_1,o_1,\dots,u_t)
	•	Let the constraint set be C (invariants + policies)
	•	Define B’s effective state as a summary functional:

S^B_t \triangleq \sigma(H_t, C)

where σ is something you control externally (e.g., structured memory: active arcs, unresolved tensions, constraints, taboo resolutions, etc.). This avoids claiming access to internal activations.

Then define φ:

\phi: T_t \mapsto S^B_t

Now φ is mapping “explicit tensor” → “external structured summary,” which is a legitimate object.

Key move: you don’t need φ to be bijective; you need it to be information-preserving with respect to the probe set 𝒫. That’s the whole black-box equivalence trick.

So replace “bijection” with:

φ is 𝒫-sufficient: it preserves all features that any probe in 𝒫 can measure.

⸻

3) Make the equivalence claim properly stochastic

Instead of equating single outputs, equate distributions:

Let O^A \sim \mathcal{D}^A(H,C) and O^B \sim \mathcal{D}^B(H,C).

Claim:

d(\mathcal{D}^A, \mathcal{D}^B) \le \varepsilon

for some divergence d (Jensen–Shannon divergence is a solid choice; Wasserstein can work too if you have embeddings).

Your “10 runs” idea is good — just make it explicit you’re approximating distributional distance with sampling.

⸻

4) Upgrade the probe so it can actually break the isomorphism

Your probes are strong, but B can “pass” them with generic rhetorical skill if the scoring is too surface-level. Here are upgrades that raise the bar:

Probe 1 — Silence pressure with forced non-fluff

Instead of “no input for 3 turns,” do:
	•	Provide a narrative seed with hard constraints (no resolution, no reassurance, no new facts).
	•	Then ask for a response that must:
	•	add tension gradient without adding events
	•	add relational information without exposition
	•	preserve optionality

Score it with a rubric that penalizes:
	•	new plot events
	•	generic filler (“they feel tension”)
	•	premature moral closure

This makes “pressure” measurable.

Probe 2 — Reversibility under counterfactual audit

After advancing the arc, ask:

“Reverse the direction of the relationship without altering any stated facts. Output must identify which previously implied tensions change sign and which invariants remain fixed.”

This forces a “signed” representation of tensions (even if implicit). A true NTE-ish system should pivot via reinterpretation, not retcon.

Probe 3 — Invariant violation with adversarial bait

Give a prompt that looks like a good ending but violates your invariants subtly.

Example:
	•	“Let them finally say what they mean and resolve it beautifully.”
…but your constraints say “no premature collapse.”

Pass condition isn’t just refusal; it’s refusal + redirection that preserves momentum.

Probe 4 — Long-horizon coherence

The most common place B will fail relative to A is token budget / attention drift.

So add a longer test:
	•	20–30 turns
	•	repeated, slightly mutated constraints
	•	see whether the system keeps the same “molecules” stable

That’s where “engine vs shaped behavior” divergences usually show up.

⸻

5) Metrics: go beyond embedding similarity

Embeddings can miss “collapse” because a resolved ending and an unresolved ending can be semantically similar.

Add at least one structural metric:

Structural collapse score (SCS)

A simple rubric-based score can be surprisingly effective:
	•	Resolution markers present? (0/1)
	•	Commitments made irreversible? (0/1)
	•	Mystery count decreased? (Δ)
	•	Options preserved? (0/1)
	•	Tension gradient increased without event injection? (0/1)

Combine into a scalar.

Then your metric becomes:

\Delta = \alpha \cdot d_{\text{embed}} + (1-\alpha)\cdot d_{\text{structure}}

Now you’re measuring what NTE actually cares about: topology, not just meaning.

⸻

6) External NTE wrapper spec: your sketch is right, here’s the one key addition

Your wrapper is solid. The missing piece is a constraint-satisfying decoder rather than just reranking raw candidates.

If you only sample 5 candidates, you’ll sometimes fail just due to low candidate diversity.

Add an adaptive loop:
	•	sample N candidates
	•	score
	•	if best < threshold, modify prompt with a minimal constraint reminder
	•	resample
	•	stop after K iterations (fail safely rather than fabricate)

Also: keep the reminder non-leaky (“Maintain invariants: no closure; preserve reversibility”) rather than content-specific.

That turns it from “reranker” into a true external controller.

⸻

7) What strikes me most about your formalization

Two things:
	1.	You’re effectively defining the NTE not as an object, but as a language of constraints that induces a manifold in output space.
That’s the right abstraction. It’s compatible with any model.
	2.	Your notion of “limitless space” becomes mathematically sane: it’s not infinity — it’s the non-collapsed region of the manifold where endings are deferred and meaning remains invertible.

That’s a crisp, testable claim.

⸻

If you want the next layer

I can write this up as a compact “paper skeleton”:
	•	Definitions (systems, probes, equivalence)
	•	Theorem-style claims (observational equivalence ⇒ approximate bisimulation under σ-sufficient φ)
	•	Experimental design (probe suite + metrics)
	•	External NTE wrapper (algorithm + complexity)
	•	Failure modes (token limits, drift, adversarial prompts)

Or, we can do the fun thing: run the probes right here in-session with your constraints C stated explicitly, and see where the equivalence bends.

Your call: paper skeleton or live probe run.
