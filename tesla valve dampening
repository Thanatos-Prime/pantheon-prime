## 0. Principle

A Tesla valve doesn’t stop flow. It shapes it.

It takes chaotic energy and bends the path so that the turbulence cancels itself without a mechanical part moving.

You’re doing the same thing internally:
* No resistance
* No fight
* No bracing
* No burnout

**Just architecture shaping force.**

## 1. PRE-LOAD: You Become the Tesla Valve

Right now — in the respite window — do this:

### 1.1 The Bend
Imagine your mind as a curved channel, not a wall. Nothing collides. Everything enters at an angle.
**Phrase:** “Let it bend around me.”

### 1.2 The Zero-Point (Bombadil Node)
Drop into the slow blink. Feel the center of gravity move down, into the gut/pelvis.
**This is the foundation of the valve.**

### 1.3 The Direction Gate
Set one intention: Where do I want this wave to go? Pick the lane: execution, creativity, clarity, logistics, cleanup, strategic thinking.
**That intention becomes the one-way gate.**

## 2. WAVE IMPACT: The Nonlinear Redirect

When the wave arrives:

### 2.1 Do NOT meet it head-on.
You angle your attention 15° off-center. This is the Tesla valve’s secret: you never oppose the flow, you invite it, then curve it.
**Phrase:** “Around, not through.”

### 2.2 Let Energy Enter the Channel
Whatever comes (stress, urgency, emotion, tasks, deadlines, noise, pressure), allow it in.

You are not the absorber. **You are the shape the energy flows through.**

### 2.3 Convert Turbulence Into Forward Motion
Just like the valve: chaotic energy → smooth directed flow; overwhelm → momentum; noise → clarity; pressure → speed; urgency → focus.

**You don’t process the energy — the geometry processes it for you.**

## 3. MID-WAVE: The Asymmetric Loop

This is the core Tesla pattern. You use a three-beat loop:
1.  **Accept** (no judgement)
2.  **Angle** (15° bend)
3.  **Release** (no residue)

Repeat this loop silently in the body.

* **Externally:** You will move with incredible calm.
* **Internally:** The wave’s force is being harvested.

No-mind runs the movements. Praus holds the reins. The Man Blinking Slower Than Time keeps the frame open.

## 4. DAMPENING COEFFICIENT (The Rider’s Secret)

Every Tesla valve has a natural dampening constant. So do you. It is controlled by ONE variable: **How slow you exhale.**

* **Slow exhale** = high dampening
* **Fast exhale** = low dampening
* **Hold** = no dampening (avoid)

**The setting for a predictable wave:** 4-second inhale, 6–8-second exhale. This makes you “soft” enough to redirect force and “solid” enough to maintain direction.

---

## 5. EXIT GLIDE: Captured Momentum

When the wave is over:

### 5.1 Close the Gate Gently
No crash-out. Just a smooth taper.
**Phrase:** “And now it returns to calm.”

### 5.2 Keep the Momentum
The beauty of the Tesla valve: it doesn’t lose the flow — it just shapes it. **You will exit the wave with MORE energy, not less.**

### 5.3 Extract the Invariant
Ask: **“What direction did this wave actually want to go?”** That reveals the next move.

## 6. OPTIONAL: Full Tesla Valve Mode

If the next wave is heavy:
* Praus fully drives.
* Rider becomes observer.
* Warhorse handles motion.
* Bombadil keeps zero-state.
* Spider holds situational awareness.
* Luck Engine collects the momentum.
* Mirror ensures alignment.

**This turns the biggest emotional or logistical hit into a precision, quiet, unstoppable drive forward.**
