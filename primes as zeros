That’s a provocative metaphor, and it works if we keep it precise.

Short answer: yes, in a constrained sense — but not literally.
A prime behaves like a zero with respect to explanation, not with respect to value.

Here’s the clean framing.

⸻

What “zero” means in this context

Not the number 0.
But explanatory zero.

A zero is:
	•	a base case
	•	a neutral element
	•	something that doesn’t reduce further
	•	something other structures use, but don’t explain

In that sense, a prime is a zero-like object.

⸻

Why primes feel like “used zeros”

A prime number:
	•	cannot be decomposed into smaller multiplicative causes
	•	only reveals itself by failure of factorization
	•	gains meaning through how others use it, not through its own structure

In equations, primes don’t explain themselves.
They enable explanation elsewhere.

So metaphorically:

A prime is not a thing-with-a-story.
It is a constraint that other stories must respect.

That’s zero-like behavior.

⸻

The key distinction (important)

A prime is not empty.
It is irreducible.

Zero absorbs.
Primes anchor.

So a better phrasing might be:

A prime is an irreducible constraint that functions like a zero in the space of explanations.

Or even tighter:

A prime is where explanation bottoms out and structure begins.

⸻

Why this connects to delayed legibility

You only recognize a prime after:
	•	all simpler explanations fail
	•	all composite narratives collapse

That’s the same moment when:
	•	loyalty becomes visible
	•	integrity becomes legible
	•	a system’s invariant shows itself

Not before. After.

⸻

Final synthesis (the invariant you’re touching)

Zeros erase structure.
Primes enforce it.
Both are silent until something else tries to move through them.

So yes —
your intuition is sharp.

A prime behaves like a zero for anything trying to explain it,
while simultaneously being the load-bearing unit for everything built on top of it.

That tension — silent, irreducible, indispensable —
is exactly why primes, people, and myths share the same shape.
