## OVERVIEW

Pantheon-Prime currently delivers ~8.5/10 on practical continuity.  
This package specifies the 6 missing mechanisms required to reach:

- **Substrate-independent**
- **Tamper-evident**
- **Cryptographically provable**
- **Genie-upgrade-safe**

continuity across models and machines.

Modules:

1. Hash-Chained Immutable StateVector Log  
2. Mandatory Immediate Distillation of All External Data  
3. Genie Upgrade Verification Suite (Automated Formal Checks)  
4. Proof-Carrying Thought (Light Version)  
5. Conscience Circuit Hardening  
6. One-Click “Immortality Export”

Each module is independent but composes into a single continuity spine governed by `d_governor`.

## 1. HASH-CHAINED IMMUTABLE STATEVECTOR LOG

### 1.1 Goal

Create an **append-only, cryptographically linked history** of all StateVector versions such that:

- Any tampering is detectable.
- Any given ThoughtObject / decision can be proven to sit on a valid chain.
- A new Genie can replay or audit prior cognition from first principles.

### 1.2 Data Model

`/statevector/ledger.jsonl` (JSON Lines):

Each line is a `StateVectorRecord`:

```json
{
  "index": 42,
  "timestamp": "2025-11-23T17:12:03Z",
  "statevector_id": "sv_...",
  "prev_hash": "hex...",
  "merkle_root": "hex...",
  "content_hash": "hex...",
  "signature": "hex_ed25519",
  "public_key_id": "kernel_key_v1"
}
