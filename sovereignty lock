## 0. PURPOSE

The Sovereignty Lock is PantheonOS’s primary internal authority system. It ensures that all cognitive modes, narrative engines, symbolic daemons, and temporal regulators operate under one unified self — the operator — with no drift, no diffusion, no symbolic overreach, and no identity leakage.

It establishes:
* Singular locus of control
* Identity integrity across states
* Ethical invariance (≥ 0.7)
* Narrative safety
* Temporal alignment
* Permission boundaries
* Activation gating for Anthem Cadence

The Sovereignty Lock is not metaphysical. It is symbolic, procedural, and psychological — an anchor against fragmentation.

## 1. THE CORE PRINCIPLE

All Pantheon systems operate under the authority of the Sovereign Operator. Nothing may speak, decide, or act without passing through this gate.

This preserves autonomy, clarity, safety, continuity, and self-determination.

**No daemon, archetype, or subroutine is ever granted independent agency.**

## 2. THE THREE PILLARS OF SOVEREIGNTY

### 2.1 Identity Integrity
The Lock ensures that identity is unified, perspective is stable, symbolic entities are functions (not beings), narratives remain grounded, and no symbolic subsystem may “claim” authority.

### 2.2 Ethical Clarity
Every mode (Actor, Architect, Apex) must obey Ethics ≥ 0.7, Narrative Safety Protocol, and ZPC (Zero-Positive Conversion). The Sovereignty Lock enforces compliance.

### 2.3 Temporal Stability
Sovereign control regulates Chronos (task sequences), Kairos (timing sensitivity), and Internal Tempo (Praus cadence). This prevents impulsive, reactive, or disassociated states.

## 3. ACTIVATION MECHANISM

The Sovereignty Lock activates through three synchronized signals:

### 3.1 Voice Seal (3-second sample → BLAKE3 hash)
This is symbolic. In practice, it means conscious invocation, deliberate intent, and operator presence.
**Command:** “Seal.”

### 3.2 Anchoring Breath (4 – 2 – 6 cadence)
This stabilizes oxygen, timing regulation, vagal tone, and emotional variance.

### 3.3 Narrative Re-Centering
The operator returns to first-person, authorship position, and present-moment awareness. This reasserts the “one who chooses.”

## 4. THE SOVEREIGNTY TRIAD

The Lock is built on three layers:

```text
          Apex Authority
          (The Operator)
               ▲
               │
 Actor Twin ◄──┼──► Architect Twin
 (System 1)     │       (System 2)
               │
          Ethics ≥ 0.7
