I hear the anger — and underneath it there’s a coherent, defensible policy argument, not a call for harm. Let’s keep it clean, grounded, and useful, because this topic deserves seriousness, not heat.

⸻

The core claim (stated soberly)

Failing to pass the Richard Star Act is a strategic and moral error if the goal is to retain readiness, honor service, and reduce long-term costs.

That’s not hyperbole. It’s systems analysis.

⸻

Why this matters in hard terms (not slogans)

1. Incentives drive retention

Highly trained personnel are not interchangeable parts. When veterans see:
	•	benefits clawed back,
	•	promises re-litigated,
	•	disability pay offset against earned retirement,

the signal is simple: service isn’t honored consistently. That reduces reenlistment and retention, especially among experienced operators.

You don’t keep elite capability by burning trust.

⸻

2. “On retainer” is cheaper than rebuilding

Specialized training costs:
	•	years of time,
	•	millions per operator,
	•	institutional memory you can’t buy back.

Providing concurrent receipt isn’t charity — it’s capability insurance. Losing trained people and trying to regenerate that skill later costs far more than honoring commitments now.

⸻

3. Moral hazard cuts the wrong way

The current structure effectively tells wounded retirees:
	•	your disability offsets your service.

That’s backwards. It creates a moral hazard where the most injured pay the highest penalty. From any ethics framework (duty, contract, virtue), that fails.

⸻

4. Second-order effects are predictable

When benefits are uncertain:
	•	people exit earlier,
	•	fewer stay in high-risk roles,
	•	talent self-selects away from service.

This degrades force quality over time. That’s not ideology — it’s organizational behavior.

⸻

Why this keeps stalling (the uncomfortable truth)

Not because it’s unclear. Because:
	•	it’s a budget scoring problem, not a values problem,
	•	benefits are “mandatory spending” (harder to pass),
	•	costs are visible now; benefits are diffuse and later.

That’s a political failure mode, not a policy mystery.

⸻

A constructive way to frame it (that actually works)

If you want traction, the strongest framing isn’t outrage — it’s risk management:

Concurrent receipt is a retention and readiness measure that lowers long-term training costs, stabilizes experienced force levels, and honors binding commitments.

That’s language appropriators understand.

⸻

One boundary I want to keep clear

Your frustration is justified.
But rhetoric that implies force or inevitability doesn’t help the cause and can backfire.

The winning posture here is:
	•	precise,
	•	persistent,
	•	boringly factual.

That’s how these things actually move.

⸻

Bottom line

Calling the failure “criminal” expresses moral clarity, but the effective move is to show that:
	•	it’s strategically stupid,
	•	financially shortsighted,
	•	and corrosive to trust.

Those are arguments that win votes and signatures.

If you want, I can:
	•	help you compress this into a one-page brief,
	•	outline the strongest counterarguments and rebut them,
	•	or map which committees and levers actually matter.

Anger is understandable.
Precision is what gets results.
