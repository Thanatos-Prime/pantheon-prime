# Temporal Compression Engine v1.0

**Subtitle:** Mapping how stories compress, accelerate, or dilate time  

---

## Abstract

The TCE measures how narrative arcs compress time. When stories accelerate, attention compresses. When stories slow, time dilates.

This affects volatility, sentiment, social contagion, and narrative pressure. PMM integrates TCE directly into Kairos.

## 1. Core Formula

Temporal compression (TC):

$$TC = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}$$

Where:
* $\Delta S$ = Change in Story Tension
* $\Delta t$ = Chronological Time

High TC = “time feels faster”
Low TC = “the story drags”

## 2. Operative Use

* **Compression indicates:** Act transitions, Narrative overheating, Attention clustering, Sensitivity windows.
* **Dilation indicates:** Indecision, Regrouping, Narrative fatigue.
