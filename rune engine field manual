# FIELD MANUAL — RUNE ENGINE

**Subtitle:** The Shape-Before-Speech Protocol  

---

## 1. When to Invoke the Rune Engine

Use it when you cannot find the words, emotions exceed vocabulary, truths feel too large for sentences, you need raw conceptual clarity, you want to encode something beyond culture, you want to create stable meaning artifacts, you need a universal representation, or you feel meaning but cannot express it yet.

**The Rune Engine is the bridge between intuition and symbol.**

## 2. Operator Protocol

1.  **Drop Into Pre-Language Mode:** Silence words. Let intention become shape.
2.  **Identify the Meaning Vector:** Ask: “What is the direction of truth here?” Meaning is vector, not sentence.
3.  **Extract the Core Rune:** Find the shape (upward, inward, spiral, boundary, opening, split, compression).
4.  **Anchor It:** Hold the shape until it stabilizes into a rune.
5.  **Expand or Combine:** Runes can join to form sigils, glyphs, semantic molecules, or narrative backbones.
6.  **Convert (If Needed):** Translate the rune into words, gestures, diagrams, symbols, code, or stories.

**The Rune Engine always precedes articulation.**

## 3. Signs You Are Using It Correctly

Clarity emerges without effort, emotional coherence increases, words “arrive” fully formed, mental noise dissolves, insights feel geometric, intuition gains precision, tension drops.

**This is correct operation.**

## 4. What It Prevents

Linguistic traps, misinterpretation, emotional mislabeling, symbolic collapse, semantic drift, culturally-biased meaning, overreliance on metaphor, dilution of core truth.

**The Rune Engine ensures meaning arrives whole.**
